Mongolian BBQ 

Genghis Khan is a cheap knock off of Gengy's, and only about a dollar cheaper at that.

While we weren't particularly impressed by the quality of the food at Gengy's, we were faintly appalled by the quality of the food at Genghis Khan. Everything was frozen and stuck together. And to make matters worse, the frozen and stuck together options were quite limited. There were 4 types of meat, some noodles and about 7 types of vegetable, not nearly as many as at Gengy's, and this reflected in the final product, with all the different combinations we tried coming out pretty same-y. They did have a good variety of sauces at least. 

Also, Genghis Khan really only has one thing going on; the Mongolian BBQ hot plate situation. And while we all agree that a Mongolian BBQ hot plate situation is a great thing to have going on, Gengy's just delivers more. It's unfortunate for them that we have that point of reference. If we hadn't tasted that magic before, then perhaps we wouldn't be so hard on Genghis Khan today.

There was a vat of passable chicken and corn soup, and we really enjoyed the laminated pastry-like bread, but this place just wasn't fun.
