Asian salad with carrot, vermicelli, almond, and peanut dressing 
Fried chicken burger with bacon and cheese  
Sticky date pudding with ice cream  
Churros with butterscotch and chocolate sauces  

Kelburn Village Pub has more of a restaurant ambience, dark with widely spaced tables and candles. They made some very good food ... and some very bad food. Also, they don't seem to understand what tapas are. Tapas come in smaller portions made to be shared. An Asian salad is not tapas. Neither is a steak or a piece of fish. 

The salad was simple but delicious. But what the hell was up with the "roasted" carrots - if these had been anywhere near the oven, we are monkeys uncles. The burger was hom nom nom. The construction was pretty good, everything was juicy, the hash brown extremely welcome, the tomato unnecessary. The churros were a slam dunk. They came out looking a little blackened which struck fear into our hearts, but this was just some kind of sprinkle as they were perfectly cooked. The butterscotch sauce was a particular standout, yummy and not over-sweet. 

The sticky date pudding was a disaster. The texture was dense and more like a bad slice than a pudding. Plus it had been badly burned at the edges giving those sections a chemical taste. Very unpleasant, stick to the churros.
