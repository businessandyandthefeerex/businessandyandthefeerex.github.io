DanDan Noodle  
Eggplant potato capsicum mix with rice  

Basin Noodle House is, as the name may suggest, right by the Basin. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, not necessarily the kind of place you'd notice or stumble upon. But it's a destination. And quite a few had made their way to this destination. Including us there were four tables dining in, and plenty of takeaway traffic, so we thought that they must be doing something right. 

The service was prompt and friendly and the prices affordable. The eggplant potato capsicum was delicious. Sweet, but not sickly, the vegetables were in good proportions with each other and were cooked just right. 

Business Andy quite enjoyed the DanDan noodles, and it's a good thing he did, because after two bites The Fee-Rex slid the bowl back over and exclaimed that it was pretty gross. While his descriptors were "flavourful, sweet, the right spice level" her descriptors were "boring, weird not nice flavour, nothing much going on".
