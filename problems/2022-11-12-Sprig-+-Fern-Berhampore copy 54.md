BBQ bacon & beef burger  
Loaded waffle fries  

Neither the Fee-Rex nor Business Andy knows why we keep ordering loaded fries and hoping for something different. There's a problem with the distribution of the load every single time. We yearn for a day where cheese, sauce, bacon, and sour cream aren't all contained in a single giant slug resting in the middle of the plate. 

That day was not today. The sauce on the loaded waffle fries was really nice, some kind of spicy tomato thing that they may well have made themselves, but it was all up one end, we got about one waffle each with too much sauce, and then not enough for the rest. And this pattern was repeated for the cheese and sour cream. There was simply not enough bacon fullstop. This was perhaps a mercy, for if there had been enough, it would have no doubt been all in one mouthful. 

The sauce that came with the burger and chips was a bit of a letdown after that rather nice tomato sauce from the waffle fries. They looked somewhat similar at first glance, but once the Fee-Rex dipped one tiny finger into it to try it by itself, we realised that it was just a bland, bulk buy BBQ sauce of some variety. The chips themselves were passable, although some of them were a bit overdone. And the burger was as middling as the rest of this meal. A bit dry, not enough sauce, but otherwise just okay.
