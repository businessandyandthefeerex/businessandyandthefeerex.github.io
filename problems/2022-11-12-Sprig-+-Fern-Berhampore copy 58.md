Malai kofta with plain naan and rice  
Mughlai aloo with garlic naan and rice  

We have long suspected that in most Indian restaurants there are several dishes which are exactly the same sauce but in the menu multiple times under different names. Tonight, we finally had confirmation. When we ordered the malai kofta and the mughlai aloo, we weren't suspicious they were the same. In the menu they didn't sound exactly the same. The waitress took our order, then popped back from the kitchen to tell us both dishes have the same base, and to ask if that was okay. Props to them for tackling this head on, and not acting like our shahi paneer wasn't just a korma. She did sound a bit sheepish, like we'd caught them with their pants down. 

The curry sauce itself was rich and creamy as described, but got a bit monotonous and wasn't a taste sensation. The koftas were also on the plain side, and the aloo was just boiled spuds chucked in the sauce. Why would people want that? Bring me a roast potato and we'll talk. The naans were bloody good - fluffy, a little crisp, hot and delicious.
