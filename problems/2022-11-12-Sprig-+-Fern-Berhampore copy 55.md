Chicken jalfrezi  
Malai kofta  
Plain naan  
Jalebi  
Gulab Jamun  

Indian sweets and snacks offers a full curry and naan menu as well as some Thai and Chinese options. However we theorise that all these main meals are really an afterthought, with the sweets and snacks (of which there is a wide variety across two deli cases and are sold by the kilo) being the star. It would certainly explain the quality. 

Firstly, the curries were too hot, especially the jalfrezi. We ordered mild, very clearly. In fact, he asked us twice. But what we received was definitely not mild and Business Andy had a bad case of runny nose. The chicken and the koftas were both super dry. And the naans were weird. Wholemeal and unleavened they were unpleasant and not as described in the menu. 

To test our theory that the sweets were really the main event, we bought a couple for dessert. Surprise surprise they were significantly better than the mains. Just scrap the curries guys and stick with what you know.
