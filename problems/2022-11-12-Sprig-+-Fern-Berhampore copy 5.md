Pizza capricciosa  
Fried chicken  

While we thoroughly enjoyed seeing The Goose in his latest smash hit, we didn't enjoy our meal quite as much. Much like The Goose, the toppings on the pizza were truly larger than life itself. Too large, in fact. But had they been smaller, the pizza sauce would still have been bad. The base was pretty good at least. 

The fried chicken pulled this meal up to their 2 rating, and the soy sauciness of the marinade ensured they couldn't go any higher. The chicken itself was actually quite good; juicy, crispy, and sprinkled with yummy sesame seeds.
