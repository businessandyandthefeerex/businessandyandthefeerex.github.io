Chicken burger  
Fish burger  
Iceberg lettuce, fried chickpeas, radish and blue cheese salad  

Twist! After our quiz team took a break for nearly two months, we were shocked to find on our return to Parrotdog that the menu had changed again! This time it was just the salads that had a revamp though, rather than the entire menu. Nonetheless, we found ourselves with some new items to try. 

The iceberg lettuce salad exceeded expectations. It was the dressing that did it - it was super flavourful and very generously applied. The chicken burger was good as always. We ordered the vegetarian burger and so were very confused when what showed up looked nothing like what we were expecting. It took us a few bites to figure out that it was actually fish. Their vegetarian burger is called "the veg" and the fish burger "the fish", so we suppose in a noisy pub they could get mistaken. Regardless, the fish burger, while not a favourite, was a bit better than we'd remembered, so there's a bonus.
