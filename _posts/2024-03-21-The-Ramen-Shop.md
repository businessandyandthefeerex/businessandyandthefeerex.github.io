Dan dan chicken ramen  
Tofu rice bowl  

There's not a lot of ramen shops out there, or at least there aren't a lot in our neck of the woods. But if anything, going to another ramen joint right after Hey Ramen just throws the differences between them into a sharper relief. 

The food was much better, and the broth in particular was very good. Super hearty, spicy and peanutty just as described. The tofu and vegetables in the rice bowl were all well prepared, and there was plenty of mapo sauce on the top. The star of the show was obviously always going to be their sweet gunpla collection though, and we also really liked their mural of an astonishingly determined pig flying towards a bowl of ramen.
