Cheese burger  
Fish burger  

After only a few outings, we have again finished the Parrotdog menu and are ready to once more issue an overall rating. While Parrotdog's performance has improved a bit, it wasn't enough to push them out of the overall 2 category. Keep reaching for that rainbow, Parrotdog. We look forward to giving you another chance when your menu changes again. 

The fish burger exceeded expectations. We were worried it would be the same as the market fish, which was pretty grim. But the fish was spiced and flavourful, the salad well balanced, the sauce yummy and the fish fresh. The cheese burger patty was on the dry side, as is a theme for beef patties at Parrotdog, but it was otherwise a good burger.
