Vegan burrito  
Banana, walnut, and peanut butter bagel  
Potato tots with aioli  
Banana smoothie  

Whoa, guys, check out this burrito. Oh my stars. This was the type of simple perfection which has us leaving asking why everybody isn’t serving this. There was nothing fancy going on - potatoes that had been boiled then lightly fried, beans, avocado, tomato, scrambled tofu, spinach. Well constructed in a burrito that wasn’t inclined to fall apart and then toasted to perfection. No cold spots here. No sauce, it doesn’t need it. This kind of dish just drives home, you don’t have to be fancy to get a 4. Anyone can do it, your food just has to be good. 

However, Little Blue Kitchen didn’t get a 4 as unfortunately their other dishes, while good, didn’t reach these heights. The smoothie had a yummy maple flavour but was a bit thin. The tots were dangerously over-salted. And the bagel was delectable if you got some with banana, but a total trudge for the half that was banana-less. 

But hey, we’d come back time and time again for that burrito.
