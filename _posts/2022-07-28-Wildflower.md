Six course degustation

This meal pushed the boat out in terms of ingredients, textures, and flavours. While we appreciate innovation, the skill and hard work of the chefs, and love to try something new, not every course was a winner. 

We won’t even attempt to accurately describe the dishes. When each came out, the waiter settled into a lengthy exposition of the individual components and how they had been prepared. Some highlights though: the canapé which was some kind of duck pate on a fluffy scone thing, a lot of people liked the really smoky and tender tiny steak which was course four, course five “the pre-dessert” was a custardy thing with dehydrated mandarin set into it, and the after dinner weeny-fudge. 

In terms of low-lights, the dessert proper was an otherwise really nice crumbly, powdery, chocolate dish with way too much beetroot. The potent red goo just overpowered everything and was very earthy, which is not really ideal at pudding time.
