At Latitude 37 everything was good, but nothing was excellent. Across the board there were no standouts in either direction, it was just universally enjoyable. They could do with turning the music down a few decibels as you definitely had to shout especially once the live music started. And shout out to their cocktail menu, especially the clockwork orange.
