Grilled pork wrap  
Lemongrass beef bao buns with fries  

A few years since our last visit to Saigon Restaurant, some things have changed and some stay the same. We were glad to see the live music was gone, but they are clearly addicted to over-loud music as their replacement pop music tunes were still excessive in volume. In the stay-the-same category, chips are still going strong at this Vietnamese restaurant. 

We weren’t particularly hungry so ordered two of their “light meals”. Buyer beware, these are not light. The chips portion alone was substantial, the bao buns were the most stuffed we’ve ever had in our lives. On one hand, hello value for money. On the other hand, did we want that much meat in there? -Not really. The lemongrass flavour wasn’t very noticeable, and beef was almost the only ingredient in the bun, except a little carrot hidden underneath and a couple of coriander leaves and some kind of sauce on the top. 

The flavour of the wrap was alright, but the construction was nightmarish. It presented like a Turkish kebab, wrapped up in tinfoil and cut in half. At first it seemed okay, a tight wrap containing your meal and preserving your dignity. But get ready to hide your shame, because about half way through the tortilla peters out and you realise it’s been rolled like a pancake with an exposed end hidden in the tinfoil wrap. This thing has a life of its own. Sauce will spray and drip with reckless abandon, bits of meat will be expelled, and you will be slopping from that tinfoil like an absolute pig.
