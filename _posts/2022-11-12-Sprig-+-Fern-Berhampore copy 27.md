Bacon and egg pie  
Feta, pumpkin and caramelised onion tart  
Banana smoothie  

Hey, Sierra Cafe. If you offer banana smoothies, but all you have is unripe green bananas, take the smoothie off the menu for a few days until those bad boys yellow up. How dare you serve us what tasted like a banana skin smoothie. Unripe bananas are not sweet, and they have a very distinctive, in a bad way, flavour. The coldness and texture of the smoothie was at least correct, but we can't get past that flavour. 

Unfortunately the food wasn't any better. The bacon and egg pie had a serious case of soggy bottom and contained surprise unwelcome tomato. The feta, pumpkin, and caramelised onion tart, which sounds delicious and looked alright in the cabinet, tasted like nothing. They did serve it with a decent tomato relish, but when eating relish plus tart all you could taste was the relish so what's the point.
