Gyoza  
Beef udon soup  
Chicken katsu with curry sauce, rice, salad, and miso soup  

Ozeki is an affordable eatery that encourages BYO, the kind of place you could bring the lads. We know this as there was a table of 30 rowdy dudes in their early 20s revelling in their cheap BYO wine. Looking around Ozeki is well equipped for this, with more huge tables than there were tables for 2-4. 

The food was middling. We were happy enough with the gyoza, but the beef that came with the udon was chewy and there wasn't much of it. The soup itself had vegetables per the menu description, but they were few and far between with only one piece each of broccoli and cauliflower, maybe four pieces of carrot and one ball of mystery greens. The broth itself was passable, if a bit heavy on the soy, sesame and bonito flavour. 

The katsu itself was very thin and the curry sauce was a bad example. It came with two piecesof potato and one piece of carrot, boiled to the point of disintegration. Unless you're a lad pack looking for a reasonably priced place to get the night started, don't even bother.
