Secret recipe beef sauced noodle  
Pork steamed buns  
Potato skewers  

Let's start on a positive - points for hand pulling your own noodles. We saw the guy doing it and it was both enjoyable and impressive. The results were fresh and a good amount of chewy. Were they too long? We suppose that's a question of personal preference, but noodle cutting scissors were provided (once we were seen biting through them like animals). While the flavour of the beef was good, it all went down to the bottom big time. Even though we used the fork to try and mix everything through, this was ineffective. However their biggest crime was the bok choy, including two pieces with a chunky ice cold base. Talk about unpleasant. 

They also really fell down hard on their faces in the steamed bun department. Another promising start with a nice fluffy bun, but then another catastrophic fall to earth when they forgot to put anything nice in the middle. Don't bait us with a picture of a saucy filling in the menu, and then switch it to a grey lump of the world's saddest pork mince when the time comes to deliver. 

Surely they can't mess up potato skewers, we thought. This is some low hanging fruit; fry some potato and put it on a stick. Yum. We like that. Unfortunately what they served us was both undercooked and overgreasy. Gross.
