Fried chicken  
Chicken burger  
Roast pumpkin salad  

A better showing tonight, but to be fair, the best two thirds of our meal was essentially the same thing: fried chicken. 

The pumpkin salad was unusual. Or at least the labneh that came with it was unusual, the puffed rice on top was fun and the pumpkin was well roasted, but overall it just wasn't quite right. Interesting, but not delicious. The chicken was pretty good across the board, not flavourful or juicy enough to reach 4 status, but still nice.
