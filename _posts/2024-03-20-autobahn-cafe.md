Beef nachos  
Lamb burger with chips  
Banana smoothie  

Itâ€™s a bad sign if your establishment reminds us of Burger King. Both eateries were happy to spend big bucks on making the air conditioning freezing cold if it meant that punters would be in and out as fast as they could. And neither establishment had spared a dime to make the food any good. 

The nachos were dreadful. The chips were extremely bland, thin and weak and almost all already broken when they arrived. The mince was flavoured, but not in a tasty way. Thank god there was enough sour cream, which is not a given in our experience. 

The burger, proudly touted as gourmet, was anything but. Cheap greasy lamb patty, bog standard bun, and not a lot of care put into the cooking e.g. underdone floppy onion. The chips were hot and fresh with plenty of them, but where was the salt? They had provided salt on the table, although the shaker was 60% rice. But who wants to eat an unsalted chip? They also came with no aioli or sauce, although we were able to scavenge a bottle from the counter. 

The smoothie was the best of the bunch, but a bit yoghurty and the presence of real banana was questionable. Also, this meal was bloody expensive for what it was. The sad fact is that the Autobahn has been around for many years, The Fee-Rex remembers coming here 25 years ago, and as long as people with low standards are driving in and out of Auckland, it will be here for many years to come.
