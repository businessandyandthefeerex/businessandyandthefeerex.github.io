Fresh fruit salad with Greek yoghurt  
Mocha  

The problem with cafe breakfast is that it's all the same, but nowhere is this more true than at London Quay Cafe. We're sure that you could guess every single thing that was on the menu. Take a few wild guesses, we'll wait.

Toasted muesli: check

Eggs Benedict: check

Bacon and eggs: check

Big breakfast: check

The lunch menu had a couple of things that were a little more interesting, but this breakfast menu was just despairingly unimaginative. To make matters worse, there was no Greek yoghurt, or yoghurt of any nationality with our fruit salad, and the mocha wasn't very nice either. We will say that the salad was fresh, and was a good mix of different fruit; it wasn't just all rock melon.

A note about music. We like Nelly feat. Kelly Rowland's 2002 smash hit Dilemma as much as the next guy, nay, more than the next guy, but it was oppressively loud. Perhaps if they had turned the volume of the music down, and the volume of the menu up we would have had something nice to say.
