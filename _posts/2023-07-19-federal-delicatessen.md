Poutine with pastrami  
American hot dog  

Now that we've eaten at this cool diner twice, we have been accepted into the ranks of the Cool Peopleâ„¢. Don't even speak to us if you are one of those unacceptably lame losers who would call Federal Delicatessen by it's full name, sheesh, we'll be referring to it as the Fed Deli from now on.

Fed Deli put on another good meal this morning. The poutine would have been better with more cheese curd and gravy, but it was poutine, so although it wasn't the best version of what it could have been, it was still a very enjoyable dish. 

If they had put a more interesting sausage in the hot dog, they would have had an excellent dish on their hands. As it was, with a nicely toasted bun, a delicious onion chutney, and plenty of mustard, it was really nice, only just shy of greatness.
