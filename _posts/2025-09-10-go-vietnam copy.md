Mac & cheese  
Bangers & mash  

There's just no coming back from that mac & cheese. Completely flavourless, absolutely massive, what an ungodly undertaking. One of the distinguishing features of a 1 is that we can easily list 3 ways to instantly move it to a 2 with next to zero effort. 1 - Put on some frickin salt and pepper. 2 - Grill some cheese on the top (we know what you're thinking, that's minimum standard, and you're right). 3 - Shave at least $4 off the price of this meatless concoction that you make in a vat for less than $5/portion. Would the addition of meat or chicken (for a price) have made it better? Yes. But you shouldn't have to add an extra in order to make a meal edible. 

The bangers and mash was better, but there was nothing to raise it above okay. The sausages weren't the cheapest ever, which was something. But this was no better than what you'd make at home when you're not even trying. Also, watch your timings. Mash and peas are both prone to rapid cooling so use a hot plate and get it out to us pronto. 

When we go anywhere, we're always on the lookout for a cocktail menu. So we were excited to find Strathmore Local had a list of about 10, and not just the most standard of fare either. We were disappointed to be told that the bar staff were too busy to make cocktails. Yes, the place was busy, it was a Friday night. But there seemed to be a lot of staff, there were still tables available, and the cocktails did not appear complex. Instead we ordered tap water, so jokes on them. Actually jokes on us, they just bought a helicopter with the profits from the mac & cheese.
