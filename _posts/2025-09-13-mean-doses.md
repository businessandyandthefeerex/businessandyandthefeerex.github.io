Jackfruit burger  
Tater tots  
Cheesy garlic flatbread  

While the Mean Doses menu is small, and geared towards the while-you're-having-a-beer-you-might-want-some-food-too crowd, the food was actually pretty good. Surprisingly, the standout was the tots! These are regularly soggy blobs with a cheap tomato sauce, but not tonight. Perfectly crisp, hot and fresh, a spicy sprinkle and a tangy mayo, you can't ask for more and we were lapping them up. 

Also good was the flatbread. It had genuine cheesy flavour, detectable but not overwhelming garlic, and an appropriate texture. The jackfruit burger was not so good. The pattie was chunky with a tendency to fall apart, and we wish they'd cut the pickle up smaller.
