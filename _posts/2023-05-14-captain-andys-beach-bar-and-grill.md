Hawaiian chicken burger with chips  
Coconut noodle salad  

Captain Andy doesn’t seem to care much that such bad food is being served on his watch. We don’t even know why we keep coming back. Okay scratch that, we know exactly why we keep coming back. It’s because he’s the only food for miles in every direction, and it was raining, and we were without transport. 

This seems to happen where there is a captive audience, where people don’t have other options, there is some force that depresses good food, good vibes, and good service, leaving only ashen disappointments. Airport cafes have wronged us similarly in the past. 

At least the chips were hot this time, although it’s a bit unbelievable that it took them three tries to get it right. And the burger was the best burger of theirs that we have tried. It even matched its description this time, with no surprise ingredients. Can you believe that this is how low they have set the bar? Neither can we, and yet they still managed to limbo under it with the coconut noodle salad. It sounded really fun on the menu, but what they served ended up being very similar to a KFC coleslaw with some strips of sort-of-fresh coconut mixed through. Easily the worst thing they have served us, which is frankly impressive.
