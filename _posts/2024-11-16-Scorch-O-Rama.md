The black hole: poached eggs on wilted spinach, black pudding, and hashed potato cakes with a mustard hollandaise  
Cinnamon sugar croissant French toast with caramel sauce, banana, berry compote, oreo crumble, and chocolate chip mascarpone  

Scorch O Rama continues to be the home of some of the finest thickshakes in the land. We tried a 'build your own' one this time, and it was great. 

The eggs were a bit over, but the whole black hole dish was just excellent overall. The mustard hollandaise really elevated this dish, it was quite a different flavour to your average boring egg dish. 

The French toast was too sweet. Yes, we know that the description of the meal implies it's going to be sweet, and we were prepared for it to be sweet. But not that sweet. They could lose the caramel sauce for a start, and tart up the compote. It was nice, but you definitely didn't want a whole plateful of it.
