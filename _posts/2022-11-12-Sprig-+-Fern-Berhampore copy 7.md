Poached eggs on toast with haloumi  
Mushrooms on toast  
Banana smoothie  

Common Ground Cafe puts in a solid performance in the brunch space, including fast service despite being busy. The menu is traditional but with a little bit of flair. The poached eggs were top notch, and the toast fresh and tasty. The mushrooms were a little controversial. Business Andy thought they were great, the Fee-Rex thought the dish had notes of feet, probably due to the parmesan. The weakest link was the banana smoothie, which was heavy on the yoghurt but light on overall banana flavour.
