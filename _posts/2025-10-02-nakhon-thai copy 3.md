Polenta chips  
Fried cauliflower  
Nosey porker pizza  

Damn does this place still know how to do a pizza. Once again the base was perfection, we watched them being rolled out to very, very thin. A warning though - while we didn’t order the cheesy garlic bread again, we see that for some reason this is no longer on their standard base and now comes on a pre-made naan base, so buyer beware. Buyer also beware of the sides at Floating Rock, which are not in the same league as the pizzas. The polenta chips had good rosemary flavour but were way overcooked. We appreciated how homemade the fried cauliflower was, but it was light on flavour and they’d used all these tiny little dreg florets that were pretty hard to eat. Thank god for the pizza, which has kept Floating Rock holding steady at a 3.
