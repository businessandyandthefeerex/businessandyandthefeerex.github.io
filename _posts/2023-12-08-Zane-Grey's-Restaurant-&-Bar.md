We ate dinner here in November 2023 

Fish chips and salad  
Cheese burger with chips

Screw you Zane. We’ve been to places like this before, tourist traps with a great location who then don’t need to try because they know people will come in thanks to the location, and with most just passing through return business is no concern. 

Fair play, it is a beautiful spot with plenty of seating on a large deck jutting out into the water, the kind of place you can watch the birds and hope to see a dolphin. 

That’s where the compliments end. Here are their food crimes in no particular order
 - Overpriced
 - The worlds tiniest sliver of lemon to squeeze on the fish. You couldn’t even squeeze it, it just crumpled into dust, that's how thin it was. It was less than enough lemon for a gin and tonic
 - Menu said aioli then the chips came with tomato sauce instead. Stop it you lazy fucks. 
 - Totally gutless tartare sauce. It was so gutless it might have actually just been bland aioli, but it came with the fish we figured it was meant to be tartare. 
 - Bad chips. We had difficulty pinpointing what exactly made them bad, they were not cold or soggy or anything obvious, they just didn’t taste good and were a labour to get through
 - Terrible distribution of bacon in the burger. It was literally all in one corner, meaning that Business Andy never even knew there was bacon in the burger at all as his half contained zero bacon. 

We won't stand for it, Zane.
