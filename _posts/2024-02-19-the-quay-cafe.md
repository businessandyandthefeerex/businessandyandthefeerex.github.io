Beef burger and chips  
Chicken burger and chips  
Iced mocha  

Last time we were here, quay cafe gave with one hand, and tooth away with the other. This time, things were on a much more even keel, and that keel was decidedly meh.

Their biggest crime was saying that they would put halloumi in their beef burger on the menu and then not delivering. The halloumi was the reason why we ordered that burger, and you’re a complete fool if you think you’re going to get away with that. It’s distinctive, and people love it, literally nobody is going to be fooled by that slice of melted cheese that you put in the burger. The beef burger was otherwise alright, although the beef patty was clearly not made in house.

There was nothing obviously wrong with the chicken burger, although the aioli that was apparently inside was a bit flavourless. There were three onion rings sat atop the thing which confused us at first, we had expected them to be waiting for us inside, but instead we ate them as they apparently intended us to, by themselves. The chicken inside was described on the menu as “fried southern style” but that turned out to be perhaps a bit misleading. 

All in all, the quality of ingredients was pretty low across the board, which makes it hard to really succeed in the flavour department. This is the second chance they’ve had, which is a lot more than many places get. We won’t be aiming for a third.
