Marinated olives  
Bread, cheese and dips  
Salami with bread, dip and cornichons  
Heirloom tomato salad  

This is an illustrious night for Business Andy and the Fee-Rex. For the first time ever, we have finished a restaurant's menu. We have now tried every item on the Parrotdog menu, except the ceviche salad and the pickled veg (cos, gross). We now feel uniquely qualified to give a historic 'overall rating', taking into account all outings to date. 

Unfortunately, the overall rating is 'meh'. 

There's a few things on this menu we would have again; the Um-possible vege burger, as well as two dishes from tonight. The cheese and breads combo was a highlight, with perfectly grilled fresh bread, plenty of cheese which was good quality especially the blue, and the two dips were well paired. The other winner was the salami and bread. Again the bread was nicely toasted, there was a range of cured meats, and the fig jam was a pleasure. Less successful was the bowl of olives. There was a mix of olives, but the black and brown ones weren't very flavourful, and the pieces of sundried tomato were way too small. The heirloom tomato salad was poor. They're throwing around the word 'heirloom' with gay abandon - this was a normal tomato, and some cherry tomatoes. What's heirloom about that? Bring in a purple and a yellow tomato, then we'll talk. Furthermore the avocado was just a huge half right in the middle. We're surprised they bothered to take out the stone. The cashew caesar dressing wasn't a hit and certainly wasn't enough to salvage this abysmal salad.
