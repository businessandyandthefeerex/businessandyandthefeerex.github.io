Turangi Bridge Motel did not want us around. We showed up and asked for a table and were asked whether we had a reservation. Mate, this is a crap motel in Turangi which we can see is over half empty. No, we don't have a reservation. The people at the nearby table even said "who needs a reservation in Turangi?!" The hostess' message was clear: "Go home, we don't want to serve you." Her reservation trick hadn't worked, but she had another weapon in her arsenal. "It'll be an hours wait". Lady if you think that's putting us off, you haven't met Business Andy and the Fee-Rex. Yes, we will wait. 

True to her word, it took an hour for our mains to arrive, although our entrees were pretty prompt. The mains also didn't arrive at the same time, first we had one, then three, and finally four, and while this alone isn't going to really cause a precipitous drop in a rating from 3 to 1 by itself, all these things add up to very bad service, which can affect an overall rating. 

To add injury to insult, the food was bad. The grilled fish was soggy, the steak was overdone, leathery and gristly, the side salads were literally swimming in pools of (admittedly alright) dressing. The chips were middling, they had been stingy with the camembert, the eggs were overdone, the only things that were good in any way were the breads and the dips. 

Apparently, bookings recommended.
