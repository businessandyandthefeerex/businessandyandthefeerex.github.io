Chips  
Cheeseburger  
Um-possible vege burger  

Parrotdog is a craft brewery that does a wicked Thursday night quiz and a pretty good burger. The menu is small, allowing them to churn the food out fast. The chips were fresh and delicious, thin cut, well salted, skin on and had a rather nice tomato sauce. The two burgers were essentially the same, one with meat meat and one with fake meat. The fake meat was tasty and very juicy, if anything it was a bit too soft with a tendency to smoodge out the sides. The sauces, pickle and cheese were well balanced. The pattie in the cheeseburger was a bit dry in the Fee-Rex's opinion, but Business Andy disagreed. Overall, Parrotdog's performance was about the same as our quiz team - a top half finish, but didn't medal.
