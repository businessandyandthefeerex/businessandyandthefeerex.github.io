Feta and spinach roll  
Kumara chips  
Fish burger  

Playlab Cafe is a more sophisticated dining establishment at rainbows end, which they describe as "our allergen and cultural friendly dining zone". Ooh lah lah. 

The feta and spinach roll exceeded expectations. The flavour was reasonable and the pastry was crispy. A dipping sauce wouldn't have gone astray.

Kumara chips have a reputation for being soggy, so you could colour us pleasantly surprised when these ones were very crisp. If anything they were a little burnt. They even came with a reasonable aioli. 

The fish in the burger was panko crumbed and generously sized, which was several steps better than what we were expecting. It was a bit fishy though and the rest of the burger was uninspired, and was notably missing any sauce.
