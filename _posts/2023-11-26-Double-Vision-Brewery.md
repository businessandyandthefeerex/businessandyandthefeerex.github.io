Marmite cheeseburger and chips  
Vegetarian nachos  

DVB, we need to talk. You run a bad quiz. It's inconsistent, there are always multiple questions with ambiguous or incorrect answers, and you don't give the answers after every round but instead save them up for some reason. You also run a bad kitchen. We weren't impressed last time, when we gave you a 2, but today was even worse. 

The chips were not hot. They came with a tomato sauce which tasted like tomato paste. The nachos were cold. They were swimming in an alcoholic cheese sauce which was like cheese melted in a dreggy beer bottle. The burger patty was way over done and the flavours weren't great, although we did like the chopped jalapenos in there. 

We wouldn't go to your quiz if our friends didn't go there. And we wouldn't go to your restaurant if we didn't go to the quiz. Lucky for you, as we come monthly for the quiz you'll probably get another shot to feed us. Do better.
