Sriracha fried chicken burger  
Fish tacos  

If you put the word "Gourmet" in your burger title, you'd better be ready to bring the heat. Unfortunately, Rust was not. The biggest problem was the chicken. The pieces were absolutely colossal, way too much for a burger. The coating was poorly adhered to the meat so when you bit into it the coating just slipped off and the meat flew out everywhere. On top of that, the melted cheese under the top bun had stuck to the coating, so it really stood zero chance of staying together. The sriracha was only in the coating, so most of the burger was pretty bland and sriracha-less. The tacos were a non-event. Super cheap battered fish that was a bit fishy, and not much flavour. 

Also, please turn on some music, or a TV, or something. The silence in this place was deafening. No wonder there was nobody frequenting the bar, all you could hear was your own cutlery, glasses and disappointment.
