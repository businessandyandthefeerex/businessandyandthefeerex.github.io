Spicy volcano pizza  
Garlic cheese and caramelised onion pizza  

Many pizza places try to do a crispy thin crust, but few succeed. Floating Rock Cafe has absolutely nailed it. Super thin, crispy across the entire base, toppings all the way to the edge and none of those unfortunate bubbles you sometimes get with a wood fired job. 

The garlic cheese and caramelised onion pizza was also perfection. The garlic was present but not overwhelming, the cheese was just the right amount, and the onion was sweet and plentiful. The spicy volcano was good but not great. The jalapeños could have done with cutting up and we would have preferred a spicier sausage to the mild salami that was provided. Regardless, this is the best pizza we’ve had in a while. Buster, the morbidly obese resident dog, clearly agrees - he seems to eat at least two pizzas a night. We strongly recommend you come to Floating Rock Cafe, and strongly recommend you don’t feed Buster.
