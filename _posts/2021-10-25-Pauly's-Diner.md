Wowzers. What a meal. It was so good that we're still buzzing about it days later. Everything was perfect. The shake was out of this world, how did they do it? Both the flavour and the texture were excellent, and we could both smash one right now. The fried chicken in the chicken burger was crispy and delicous, they didn't try to stack too much other stuff in the burger, so even after passing it between The Fee-Rex and Business Andy multiple times the brioche bun held together. 

The two fried chicken baskets were essentially the same perfectly cooked, succulent, crispy fried chicken with two different sauces. We can't agree on which was better, but they were both fantastic. Even the fries stood out, everything that came out of that tiny kitchen was crispy, not greasy, and had been made with love. You can really tell when someone cares about what they are producing, and Pauly cares a lot. 

There's only four tables at Pauly's Diner, so be prepared to take away if need be.
