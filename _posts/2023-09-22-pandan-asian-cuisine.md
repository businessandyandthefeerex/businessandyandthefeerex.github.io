Lamb tikka masala  
Tofu rendang  
Garlic chennai  
Butter chennai  

If you are looking for excellent service, then look no further than Pandan Asian Cuisine. The guy looking after our table was downright delightful, he hit the perfect balance between attentive, charming, and professional. 

The food didn't quite reach such a high, but it was still good. The tofu rendang was the stronger curry with a lovely aromatic sauce, although the tofu itself didn't quite hit the right texture. The lamb tikka masala was a bit uninspired. It wasn't just tomato soup like we've had before, but was nothing to write home about. Both curries were pleasantly mild, but still a tiny bit spicy, just right. 

Chennais are rotis, as we found out tonight. And while we like roti, roti ain't naan. Roti is just a bit too small, and a bit too thin to make a good accompaniment to a curry. Also, would it kill them to cut the roti instead of leaving it as such an ungainly square?
