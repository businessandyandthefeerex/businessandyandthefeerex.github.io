Thai vegetarian curry and rice  
The works burger with chips  

Captain Andy has taken us all hostage. If you can’t be bothered leaving the resort to eat somewhere else, and the Captain knows you can’t, you lazy sods, then you’re going to have to eat what the Captain makes. Under no other circumstances could you get away with serving a meal like this. 

A basket of cold, floppy, tiny chip dregs alongside a burger which would have slid apart on the plate if not for a heroic skewer keeping it all together. The extremely poor ingredient distribution wasn’t helping; pineapple on one side, egg somewhere inside covering about three quarters of the patty. The best thing we can say about this burger is that the patty wasn’t dry at least. The curry was a-whole-nother type of sad affair. It was extremely bland and just a real bummer to eat. Providing a roti would have helped an awful lot but that was clearly beyond them. 

Sloppy work from the Captain - we’ll be organising a mutiny.
