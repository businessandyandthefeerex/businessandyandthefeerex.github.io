Pork belly bahn mi  
Pork wontons  

As far as a quick bite for lunch goes, Go Vietnam will do. Their banh mi bun was appropriately sized so you don’t have to disarticulate your jaw like an anaconda to eat it, so that was good. But the meat wasn’t worth our time and the whole thing was pretty uninspired

The pork in the wontons was notably good - densely packed, moist and of good quality. The thin dipping sauce was hard to get on the wontons in sufficient quantity, and the undressed little salad was a chore.
