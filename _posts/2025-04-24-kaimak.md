Salami pide  
Halloumi iskender  

It's a tough decision for places trying to do well in both takeaway and dine-in; door open or door closed? On one hand, door open helps traffic flow and encourages customers for the takeaway trade, as well as discouraging loitering dine-in clientele (AKA the Burger King technique). On the other hand, it's pretty bloody cold in autumn for your dine in customers. We ate in our puffer jackets. 

Luckily, the food was very good. The pide was flavourful with good sized chunks of salami, it wasn't greasy like some pide can be, and the ends weren't just useless nubbins of doughy bread, the topping went all the way to the end. It also came with two fantastic accompaniments - yellow chillis and pickled cabbage. We were skeptical when we saw these. The waiter warned us the chillis were hot, and he was quite correct as the Fee-Rex learned when she tried to eat one straight up. However, when used as intended as a pairing to the pide it was a fantastic addition, as was the cabbage. 

The halloumi iskender was also strong. There was plenty of everything and in good ratios. Generous with the hummus too, which is nice to see. Yes there could have been more halloumi, but that's basically always the case.
