Vegetarian big breakfast  
Pulled pork nachos  

Despite its name, Scorch O Rama is a very popular cafe. We went on Matariki and it was heaving. It took a while to make our order and a while for our drinks to arrive, but once we had ordered, the wait for food was pretty reasonable considering how busy it was. Luckily we had some entertainment while we waited. It was impossible not to eavesdrop on the table next door where there was seated a guy who was just the best mix of entitled and naive. The whole time we were there, he was regaling his patient dining partner with how he was going to get a sweet inheritance of "some assets" which sounded like it included a valuable car. We struggled not to laugh out loud as he described his plan to cut his brother and sister out of the inheritance, how he was the only one who could be trusted to care for the assets, how he and the hopefully-soon-to-be-deceased weren't really that close yet, but how he was going to suck up to him, and that his old relative was only going to get more old and senile. His dining partner was painfully sick of his nonsense, and when he described how his siblings couldn't be trusted with the assets she hilariously pointed out "that's probably what they think of you, that you'll let your mates use it or sell it for drugs". 

He went on and on like this, we were completely entranced as we sipped some of the best alcoholic milkshakes we've ever had. And when our food arrived, it was hard to tear our attention away from the table next door. The big breakfast was reasonably good overall, the house made hash brown was great, the wilted spinach was a bit bleh, and the inclusion of a tiny bowl of hollandaise was perplexing. The nachos were likewise good overall, the pulled pork was very good, however the guac and salsa weren't, and the chips at the bottom were beyond disintegrated by the moisture of all the stuff piled on top of them. 

They have been mentioned, but the milkshakes deserve their own paragraph. Absolutely delicious, slightly boozy, and worth every second of the wait. We also really enjoyed the super cheerful guy at the till, who showed us an excellent meme on our way out.
