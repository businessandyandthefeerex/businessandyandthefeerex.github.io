Pulled pork burger  
Fruit salad  
Lemon bread  
Liver lover juice  
Mixed berry smoothie  

The Fee-Rex used to work at an Indian restaurant, now closed, where the Jumpstart Cafe currently stands. Give our experience, we don't think this establishment will be around long either. While not ghastly, the meal was highly underwhelming. The highlight was the lemon bread, which was fresh and perfe`ctly toasted. The smoothie wasn't bad either, being reminiscent of a real fruit ice cream. The fruit salad was boring, the burger forgettable. The lowlight was the liver lover juice. The menu board described the juice as "beetroot, carrot, apple, ginger". We would suggest this description was replaced with "dirt, beetroot, far too much ginger". 

Please note the online menu at the time of posting did not match the menu available in-house.
