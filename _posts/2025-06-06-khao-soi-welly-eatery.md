Classic thai satay chicken skewers
Herbal grilled chicken 

While you never expect a 4 to show up on a dark and stormy winter's night, they seem to arrive just in time. It's been a while, and it makes you wonder if it's not them, it's us, are we too picky? Then somone comes along and just knocks it out of the park with simple food done right.

Their specialty and their namesake, the khao soi, was super rich and hearty, a curry to warm your heart with no gigantic ice cold bok choy or other such nonsense mixed in to ruin it. Every addition had its place, including all the various condiments like the unidentified paste, the lime wedge, the red onion and pickle, and the tiny jar of coconut cream. It was really easy to just trust them, and they delivered big time on flavour. 

Unusually we ordered a lot of chicken tonight. This can be a risk, we've all had dry chewy satay sticks. But every piece of chicken was tender and succulent, no gristle to be seen. The satay, which has a tendency to be cloying, came with a sort of thin vinegar dip as well as the familiar peanut sauce. We were skeptical, but again we put our faith in Khao Soi and they showed us the way. The thin dip really cut through the greasiness and added a much needed freshness to the dip. Similarly the herby sauce was perfectly balanced, although that dish came with a large piece of fancy lettuce that was no great addition to the dish. Perhaps this was meant to be decorative only, but as members of the clean plates club you'd best believe we ate it. And frankly, if you're putting something on our plate it should be considered part of the meal and treated with that level of consideration and respect. 

The tofu bites were the weakest of the bunch. They were still very good, but the tofu inside was really soft which made it hard to get sufficient levels of their excellent sauce. Also they were way too big to be actual bites and needed to be cut in half despite the fact that no knife was provided. And to finish on a compliment, the service was friendly and the food came out lightning fast. 

Bookings essential.
