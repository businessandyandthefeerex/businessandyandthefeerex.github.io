What a glow up. It's hard to believe that 3 years ago we slapped this place with a 2 after being served one of the worst fish dishes of all time (perhaps it's a three-way tie with White Horse Inn and LA Bakery & Coffee Lounge). Tonight, they have achieved our highest accolade, the coveted 4 rating. 

While Tongariro Lodge is not a tapas restaurant, tonight our group of 4 chose to order a bunch of plates and share them round. There wasn't a dud in the bunch. The halloumi, grapes and chorizo wasn't particularly exciting, but it was tasty. Perhaps the chicken itself could have had a bit more excitement in texture or flavour, but it was well compensated by two delicious sauces. 

Then we come to the stronger dishes. The flatbread came with a great hummus and was super well laminated and piping hot. The honey roasted carrots had a lovely honey flavour and were cooked just right. But two dishes stood above the rest. The cauliflower steak had this gorgeous flavour, the kind that makes you go 'why can't I make cauliflower like this at home, what have they done here?' The cheesecake was very strange, with parmesan for goodness sake, but it totally worked. The top was burnt like a brulee and it came with brulee'd fruit too, everything worked together. We've never had a cheesecake like this before, big points for innovation. Welcome to the upper echelon, Tongariro Lodge.
