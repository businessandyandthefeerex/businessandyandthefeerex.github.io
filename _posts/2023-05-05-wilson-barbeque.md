Brisket  
Pulled pork burger with chips  
Cornbread with whipped honey butter  

Dry. There's a word you don't want or expect to associate with a BBQ joint. But it was the number one descriptor of both the cornbread and the brisket. That is a crime. And especially after this restaurant waxed lyrical, harped on, in fact, about how much they love BBQ. We think they actually hate BBQ, and we hate them. 

On top of being Sahara-level-dry, the brisket was also lukewarm and didn't have nearly enough BBQ sauce. But if you thought that was bad, sister you weren't ready for how dry the cornbread was. It was borderline inedible, and if we weren't card-carrying members of the Clean Plates Club we'd have taken one bite and thrown the rest in the bin. It came with a whipped honey butter that was insanely sweet and paired very poorly with the cornbread. The Fee-Rex had to couple the cornbread with mouthfuls of chips and tomato sauce just to stomach it. 

The pulled pork burger, while not dry, wasn't good either. Business Andy got a giant slug of blubbery fat in one mouthful. And brie in this burger was a stupid idea. Doubling down on the stupid, the apple in it was like they had scraped in the contents of a McDonalds apple pie. Coupled with a brioche bun the whole thing was overpoweringly sweet. Shout out to the burger structure at least. It did perform, even in the difficult condition of being cut in half with a blunt knife.
