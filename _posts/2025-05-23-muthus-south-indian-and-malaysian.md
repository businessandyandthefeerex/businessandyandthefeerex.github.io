Murtabak  
Dosai  

This is becoming a bit of a thing lately. And we appreciate that we sound like old fogeys complaining about change when we say this, but the fully digital, no menu, no table service, no chit chat dining experience is just not that good. Or at least that was our takeaway from Muthus tonight. Yes it's very efficient, and yes there's no paper but how much paper are you really saving here? We know it's actually about staff time, so don't try and tell us different. 

And while we're telling you off, that dosa was far too crisp for dipping in its sauces, and the gap between the two dishes coming out was far too long.  Also, two of your four dosa dips looked like cat sick (green and white variants) and another had a gravel-like texture. The four sauce, which was the same curry as came with the murtabak, was pretty yum and the lamb in the curry wasn't bad either. 

It's a shame the dosa was a let down, because the murtabak was pretty good. We liked that it was a brand new dish to us, and actually there were quite a few exciting entries on the menu. Yes there was a butter chicken and masala, but many of the dishes were quite intriguing. Turns out a murtabak is a pancake folded with filling (in this case lamb) and egg. It's flavoured with spices and comes with a wee bowl of curry - yum. 

One final growling - we get that your kids are in the restaurant, fair enough when you're a family business what else are you meant to do with them. But did you have to play minecraft videos on the telly? They weren't even watching them, and you've missed an opportunity to play dope bollywood music videos which would have also added some good background noise and some much needed atmosphere to the dining experience.
