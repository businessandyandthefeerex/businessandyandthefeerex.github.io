Margherita pizza  
Gnocchi with red sauce  

Well dang. It's not normally our place to tell you how to run your business. But Araucaria, here's how to significantly improve your food while costing you nothing. 

First, mix your gnocchi halfway through microwaving. I mean, don't microwave your gnocchi at all, heat it properly in a pan or better yet cook it fresh. But to meet the barest of minimums, mix it half way through microwaving. That way you won't have blistering hot sauce at the top and ice cold gnocchi at the bottom. 

Secondly, add the basil to the margherita pizza after the cook, not before. Then the basil will look fresh and vibrant, not withered and a thousand years old. 

Thirdly, take a salt and pepper grinder to your red sauce. That goes for both the pizza and the pasta. They were bland. 

Voila, now you're passable. But until then, you're a 1. This is the former site of Bottega, which closed down about 6 months ago. Their review was contentious, but we can both agree it was a hell of a lot better than this.
