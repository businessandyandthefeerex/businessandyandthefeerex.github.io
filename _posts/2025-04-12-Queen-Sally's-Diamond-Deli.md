Banana smoothie  
Halloumi bagel  
Roast potato salad with Indian spices  
Lemon and poppy seed cupcake  
Anzac oaty caramel slice  

It's always interesting revisiting places that we've eaten, there's a potential for them to rise from the ashes like a flavourful phoenix, but that potential lives right alongside another phoenix that is about to just burst into flames and die. Sadly, Queen Sally is the latter case.

The smoothie tasted reasonably good, but was just too warm, and too thin to be called good. But this was just a small offense compared to the affront that was the allegedly Halloumi bagel. We say allegedly because that cheese was practically missing in action. Just one slice! If you're going to stinge out on the Halloumi then you're gonna have to cut it up and spread it around. As it was, you ended up hunting around the bagel, eating mouthful after mouthful of just bread and pesto, hoping, praying for some Halloumi to show up and save the day. Disgraceful. 

The roast potato salad was no bueno too. The potatoes had a funny texture, we suspect they might have been a bit old. It was very spicy but it had no warning - draw a little chilli next to it for god's sake. It had fresh corriander and parsley in it, which is yum in a salad, but the pieces were colossal which made them pretty unpleasant. 

The sweets were better than the savourys. The lemon cupcake was the weaker offering, we would have liked it more lemony. The Anzac caramel was fantastic - super thick caramel layer, good size, the ratios all on point. 

You hate to see a joint get downgraded, but Sally really left us no choice today. After three bad dishes there's really no way she could keep her 3 rating.
