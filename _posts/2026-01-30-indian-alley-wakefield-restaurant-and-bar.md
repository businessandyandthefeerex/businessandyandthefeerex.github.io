Chicken lollipops  
Cheese tomato  
Keema naan  
Peshwari naan  

Most places that fall down into Twosville don't get another look in. But we're glad we gave Indian Alley another shot tonight. We're also glad that we appear to have finally learned our lesson about special spice mixes and cocktails. We were not tricked into riding the liquid fart train this time.  

Across the board, the food was good tonight. The only footnote is that Business Andy didn't enjoy the peshwari naan, but he's not really one for peshwari naans, so that's on him. The chicken lollipops were great though. Fun to eat, with a great sauce the leftovers of which we recommend you put your rice in. 

It was nice to see giant pieces of paneer in the cheese tomato, that was just a good time. While 'cheese tomato' doesn't sound appealing it turned out great. We did feel some trepidation, worried it would be canned-tomato-soup-esque or just a butter chicken sauce, but it was neither of these things. 

The ambiance could use a little work. When we arrived we were the only people there, although 2-3 takeaway orders did go out during our meal and we were dining a little later than usual (8pm Friday night). Also, when we arrived the waiter was sitting texting and took the time to finish his message before getting up. The ladies bathroom was also pretty unappealing - toilet seat up, leaking tap, and a mysterious hobbit sized door which was open and through which a wheelie bin in a dirt-floored cupboard could be seen. How inviting.
