Butter chicken with rice and cheese & garlic naan
Malai kofta with rice and plain naan

No lube, in we go. This was the worst curry chicken we have ever had. And that's saying something. It was dry, beyond dry. Arid. How did it get so dry? It had come from a bain-marie, and yeah it had probably been there for hours, but they don't get this dry just from that. It must have been baking for a good 3 days before going into the warmer. 

Speaking of dry, the plain naan was thin and crisp. No one wants that. The cheese and garlic naan had a good soft texture, but was light on both cheese and garlic. The malai kofta was the best of the bunch, and actually the koftas were really good. 

Besides the food, there were a few other issues. They offered carafes of water, how lovely. But no glasses. Fuck you, and extra fuck you if you're thirsty after that dry ass chicken. The curries came out only warm, not hot. Coupled with cold plastic plates, this made for a tepid experience, especially in the back half.
