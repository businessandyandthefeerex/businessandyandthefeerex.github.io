Eight course degustation  

Why was this meal not a 4? Was it that Jano Bistro went too hard on the earthy, nutty, smoky flavours? Perhaps we're just not sophisticated enough for them? Every dish tonight had been cheffed to within an inch of its life - there were confits, gels, foams, reductions, compressed vegetables, a panna cotta, and multiple different powders. Everything had been put together with great care and fine tweezers, but despite all the engineering and passion, it just didn't translate into jaw dropping flavours. 

Naturally our favourite dish was the bread. The table next to us didn't eat theirs and you'd best believe we were giving them nuclear-level stink eye. There was also a dessert featuring meringue and blueberry that was pretty good, and one of the lamb servings was also very special. As to the rest, while you could see where the effort and money had gone (this was not a cheap night out) at the end of the day you just weren't sure you'd want to spend that much of your pay cheque to eat that meal again.
