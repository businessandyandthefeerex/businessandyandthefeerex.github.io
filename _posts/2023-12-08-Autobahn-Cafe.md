Lasagne, salad and roast potato  
Pumpkin carrot and leek soup  
Cheesy garlic bread  

Hey Pukenui Pacific, ever heard of salt? Or seasoning of any kind? I don’t know why we’re bothering asking, we’ve eaten your food. And it was incredibly bland. Even the roast potatoes, which looked very promising externally, tasted like nothing. Disappointing across the board *sad head shake*
