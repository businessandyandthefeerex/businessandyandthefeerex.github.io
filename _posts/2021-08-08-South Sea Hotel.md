Fish burger and chips  
Potato and celeriac soup with ciabatta  

How can you serve us fish with no tartare sauce last night, then serve a fish burger replete with tartare sauce today? You clearly had some, so you can't play the "it's hard to get stuff delivered to Stewart Island" card. It was a nice tartare sauce too, and would have greatly improved last night's meal. As it happens, the fish burger with tartare sauce was quite nice, it fell apart completely but that pretty much always happens with fish burgers. They assumed that we wanted the full portion of soup, we assumed the half portion would be standard for lunch. Future diners are recommended to request a half portion unless you are extremely hungry, because this soup was huge. The flavour was pretty good, maybe a little salty, and it could have done with a few more whizzes from the stick blender as there were frequent pieces of potato. Wouldn't kill you to toast the ciabatta either. Still an improved showing on last night.
