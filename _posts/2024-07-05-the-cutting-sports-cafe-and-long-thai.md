Fish burger with chips  
Roti with peanut sauce  
Beef massaman curry with rice  

Driving into Miramar, we're looking for somewhere to eat and spot Long Thai on the right. We park a little further up the road and walk back. Twist - right next to Long Thai is The Cutting Sports Cafe. We are duty bound to eat at the nearest place to us, which is not always the dining establishment we were heading to. We turn into The Cutting. Double twist - the two eateries share an entrance. After entering the main door we can turn left for The Cutting Sports Cafe, right for Long Thai. Left is technically closer to the car, so we turn into The Cutting. TRIPLE TWIST - they are THE SAME RESTAURANT. Two apparently independent businesses sharing one dining area, one kitchen, one set of staff. Totally reeling we decided it was most fair to have a hybrid experience and order off both menus. 

Let's start with the positive - the combination of hot, fresh, well seasoned chips dipped in the massaman sauce, a daring synthesis, was out of this world. It should be an item on the menu all by itself. We far preferred the chips with the curry sauce than what was actually in the curry - passable pieces of beef and way too big pieces of potato. The roti's peanut sauce was also good with the chips, but the roti itself was doughy rather than laminated. 

The burger was a nothing event. It came with tomato even though we had clearly requested no tomato. The fish inside was flavourless except for a bit of a fishy vibe. We think the burger had some mayo, but it was ghost mayo with no discernible taste. Put all that in a cheapy cheap bun and you've got yourself a dud burger.
