Onion bhaji  
Methi paneer  
Chicken nilgiri  
Plain naan  
Cheese and garlic naan  

We've only eaten out twice on Invercargill and by coincidence both have been Indian restaurants, for the record, Pinch of Spice is superior to Curry Guru the Malabar Kitchen in every way apart from the paneer. 

Our curries were exciting and inventive. On multiple occasions we have ordered a "different" curry only to be given what is clearly a korma or masala under another name. So both of these were a pleasant surprise. Also pleasant was the chicken which was all tender meat with no mystery gristle. As we said, the paneer was weak. It was dry and had an unfortunate texture. The bhaji was the other weak link as it was floury in the centre and didn't have enough sauce. The naans and rice both performed admirably.
