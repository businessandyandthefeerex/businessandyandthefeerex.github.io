Paneer korma  
Cheese dosa  
Dhal  
Plain roti  
Rice  

While they do technically offer dine in eating, this is really a suburban Indian/Malaysian takeaway joint. We were the only people eating in, in fact we were probably the only people who have eaten in there all year. They don't even offer plates, just the serving dishes that the actual food comes in/on. This is a first for us at an Indian place - we want hot plates, we'll accept cold plates, but no plates?! 

The food was okay on the whole. The roti was excellent, it was plump, laminated, large, hot, and critically not greasy, there is literally nothing more that you can ask from a roti. Outstanding. 

A pity that the curries were merely okay. The paneer itself deserves a special shout out. And the dosa was pretty nice, Business Andy appreciated that they had risen above mozzarella and, god forbid, Valumetric edam, and had put in a very cheesy cheddar.
