Margherita pizza  
Polenta chips  

Someone call the exterminator, this place is infested. With kids. We've been here on multiple occasions and it's pretty normal for the inside to be teeming with young'uns. Sprig + Fern encourages this through allowing BYO food and having toys on hand. Luckily there is a nice outdoor area for adults to escape to, as long as the weather is playing ball. 

The polenta chips had it going on. Super crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, good girth and a touch of rosemary. The accompanying sauce was forgettable unfortunately. 

The margherita pizza hadn't tried very hard. When a pizza doesn't have many components, you'd better have each component on point. But the red sauce was just a Greggs tomato paste, and too much of it, just tasted like red. The basil they had done as a pesto, but not a great pesto. The cheese and the base were pretty good though.
