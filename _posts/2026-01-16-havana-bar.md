Sourdough with garlic butter  
Patatas bravas  
Lamb skewers  
Pumpkin arancini  
Burrata with peach and prosciutto  

Havana Bar serve a good variety of tapas in a friendly atmosphere. The service was prompt, and the food came out lickety split - too fast if anything. We would have appreciated if the food had dripped out a bit more, we were overwhelmed by having four of our options on the table at one time, and were sad when we left the lamb for too long so that it wasn't its piping hottest when we got into it. 

The best two were the bread and the arancini. Nom nom nom we will eat that bread all day long, and thank you for providing ample butter. The arancini were piping hot, crispy as, and had a very interesting (in a good way) flavour. 

The patatas bravas were crispy with a great sauce, and while Business Andy speculated they weren't as good as the ones he makes at home, maybe he needs to chill out in his opinion of himself as these were pretty bloody good. The burrata was the weakest offering - being surrounded by the other dishes while he was so simple didn't help, but it would have been good to have some additional texture, perhaps some crushed nuts. 

The cocktail menu was interesting, while the dessert menu was not. We were in a dessert mood tonight, but we turned down Havana Bar to go to a nearby ice cream parlour, which is hardly a ringing endorsement.
