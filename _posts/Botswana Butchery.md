Crispy squid  
Saffron and osso buco risotto  

Employing a eat-at-the-first-place-we-see system, we stumbled along Botswana Butchery. It’s a little bit fancy, with prices to match, but you could see and taste where the money had gone and that’s what counts. 

The crispy squid was innovatively cut so there were rings but it was all still joined together as a single piece. This was fun but a little awkward to share. It was supposed to come with a kimchi mayo and while the mayo was visible, the kimchi was undetectable. The squid was far from chewy, but it was also not the best we’ve ever had. Overall, it was good, and in particular the batter was excellent. 

The risotto was similar, good but not mind-blowing. However the osso buco was a bit too firm, which was a shame.
