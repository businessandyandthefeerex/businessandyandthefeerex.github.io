Crispy pork spring rolls  
Pork pot sticker dumplings  
Tempura eggplant bao bun  
Vietnamese coffee creme brulee  

The Old Quarter is Vietnamese fusion dining, and there is something for everybody. Especially if you like cocktails - the menu was diverse, accessible and delicious. Meals wise it was sharing friendly,but if you wanted to just scoff a curry without giving anybody else a bite they were ready to cater to your needs. 

The dumplings were bloody good, crispy and hot with a well paired dipping sauce. The spring rolls contained heaps of pork, which is actually quite unusual - some pork spring rolls are more like lettuce spring rolls with homeopathic pork. The casing was abnormally good, managing to be very crisp without being firm, however the flavour could have been a bit more complex. 

Bao buns can be a tricky order. How many to get? Is the menu description one or two? At The Old Quarter it is one BUT they offered a cutting in half service! Genius! Why isn't everybody doing this? It made it a dream to share, as well as a dream to eat. The eggplant was delicious in flavour and texture, they'd done some kitchen voodoo to it as opposed to just throwing a piece of eggplant in batter. 

And to top it all off, we really enjoyed the brulee too. While it's not a substitute for an actual coffee with some condensed milk in the bottom of the cup, and it could have perhaps been a bit more strongly coffee flavoured, the texture was lovely, and it had a perfect crackable burnt sugar layer on the top.
