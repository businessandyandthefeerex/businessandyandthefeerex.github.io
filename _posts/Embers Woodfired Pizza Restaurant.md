Blue cheese gnocchi  
Mushroom risotto  

Embers is an Italian restaurant who, according to local Facebook groups, is on the rise again after a severe dip in quality following two changes of ownership. Embers used to be a favourite haunt of The Fee-Rex’s friend group 6+ years ago, so it was with excitement tinged with trepidation that we returned. 

We were not disappointed. The gnocchi was super flavourful, really cheesy, with good texture on the gnocchi itself. The risotto was delicious, came packed with loads of mushroom, and the servings of both were generous. If we’re nitpicking, the drinks came out quite unevenly. We were a table of 5 and there was a gap of over five minutes between the first and last drink arriving, which occurred in both rounds of drinks.  But the service in general, including delivery of the food, was otherwise quite prompt.
