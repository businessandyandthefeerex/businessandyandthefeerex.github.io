Vegetable spring rolls  
Chive nuggets  
Fried plant-based chicken with ginger rice  
Beef massaman curry  
Fried noodles with plant-based chicken  

While we've sometimes ordered takeaway from this joint, until tonight we hadn't ever dined in. After all, who actually eats at their Thai takeaway place? We had thought nobody, but there was practically a crowd gathered there tonight. 

What they were there for, we'll never know. Unless they were all exclusively eating the spring rolls, it probably wasn't worth it for them, because while the spring rolls were great, everything else really only reached the lofty heights of "okay". The chive nuggets had a nice crispness to them, but were a bit doughy otherwise. It was fortunate that they came with a really sweet and sticky soy sauce, because they were pretty forgettable flavour-wise. 

We quite liked the chicken with ginger rice, it had a lot of ginger, and compared to the noodles it was definitely the superior dish. And the massaman curry sauce was pleasantly warm, although it came with some seriously awful beef. A common tripping hazard for places like this. 

Big thanks to guest reviewers Leah & Carina.
