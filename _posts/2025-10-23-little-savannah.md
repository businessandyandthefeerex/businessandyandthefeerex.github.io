Garlic flatbread  
Roast kumara salad with lamb  
Lamb souvlaki with chips and tobacco onion  
Affogato  

It’s been a while since we’ve been to Little Savannah, and we are pleased to see they are still doing very well. On a blustery Thursday night they were really busy, but the service was still friendly and the food came out in good time. 

The garlic flatbread was a bit dry, and the little knob of butter was rock hard, but the flavour was good. The lamb on the souvlaki was bloody nice, perhaps not a surprise in Little Savannah who pride themselves on knowing meat backwards and forwards. The souvlaki was served with chips and tobacco onion, which was a new dish for us. It appears to be partially dehydrated then fried onions and was only okay. The chips were excellent, but we’d rather have had some Greek-er sides to go with the souvlaki, maybe some more bread and salad-ey stuff, and a little halloumi and tabouleh never goes astray. 

The roast kumara salad was the strongest dish of the night. It was nigh on perfect - plenty of kumara, plenty of lamb, all other ingredients in good balance, zesty citrus flavour, and a nice range of textures. The cocktail menu had changed and continues to be very exciting, we would have liked to try all the different types of espresso martinis on offer. And we’ve discovered what makes the pina coladas so good - it’s ice cream. Nom nom nom. Unfortunately the affogato was a downer to end on with some cheap vanilla ice cream bringing down the nice espresso.
