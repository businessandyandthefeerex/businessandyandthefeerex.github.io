Paneer lahori with rice  
Old Delhi butter chicken with rice  
Plain naan  
Butter naan  

Oops, we did it again. We were intrigued when we saw Yellow Chilli had a specialty Indian cocktail menu. You'll recall we were impressed by this when we saw it at Indian Alley Wakefield, and you may recall that we hated what we got there, it was basically a glass of farts. This time around we were cautious. We spotted the jaljeera mohito on the menu and avoided that cup of smelly toilet water, ordering something completely different. Alas, we were fooled. The "secret spices" they used were just jaljeera, and we had another cup of Satan's sphincter to trudge through. 

Fortunately the food was really nice. The butter chicken was really nice, and the paneer lahori was excellent. It was a pleasant surprise that even though we ordered our curries mild, they were not spiceless, as is usually the case. The naans let them down a little bit, the plain naan was too dry, and the butter naan, too oily, and it had delamination issues. 

The server was friendly but rushed off his feet. When we arrived it was okay, but the place just got busier and busier with both dine-in and takeaway, to the point that when we wanted to pay we waited a bit just to give him a chance to catch up. Maybe time to hire another server.
