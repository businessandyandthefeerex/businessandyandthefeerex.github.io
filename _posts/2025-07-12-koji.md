Nine course tasting menu  

The words sleek, chique, and tasty best describe Koji. The food was absolutely outstanding, as was the service. But we felt that they made a bit of a misstep trying to turn our table over too quickly - 90 minutes for a 9 course meal. 

We get that they really need to book each table for multiple sittings every night, but the meal ended up being pretty rushed as a result. The dishes came out quickfire, multiple at once and little gap inbetween, so you ended up feeling pretty stuffed by the end. At $130 a head (we got the bougie truffle option) it wouldn't kill them to give us some breathing space. 

That said, what a meal, it was truly delicious. There were only two dishes that we didn't love (the silken tofu and the mango ice cream), and the fried cauliflower was some of the best we've had. The other standouts were the lamb, the eggplant, and the yellow curry bao buns. 

Bookings recommended.
