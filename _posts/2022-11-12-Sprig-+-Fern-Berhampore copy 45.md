Vegetarian philly cheese steak  
Beef burger  

After a big morning deep cleaning the bathroom, we decided to roll the dice and get lunch at quiz today. While we wouldn't say we were impressed, it was at least a better performance than last time. In terms of the food. Not in terms of their new quiz master, who only gave you about 2 seconds thinking space between questions. We can't remember all seven dwarfs names in that time, be reasonable woman! 

How did they make a cheese steak vegetarian, we hear you asking? Chopped up vegetarian sausages, we answer, smothered in cheese with onions in a fresh bread roll. The Fee-Rex quite liked this, Business Andy thought there was too much cheese. We also disagreed on the burger too. Business Andy thought it was quite nice, while The Fee-Rex had two bites and couldn't eat any more, something in the burger sauce was quite repellent to her tastebuds. We could at least agree that the chips were hot with a yum chicken salt, but the tomato-pastey sauce made another appearance.
