Deep fried halloumi balls  
Jalapeno Popper  
Carnitas  
Jackfruit quesidilla  
Banana empanadas  

We dig on Mexican food and don't get to have it very often so were excited to head to taco Loco. We were (mostly) not disappointed. 

The cheesy balls were the best. Crispy, perfectly hot and cheesy as. Shout out to the jalapeno poppers too, especially for not exploding out all their cheese when bitten.

The jackfruit quesidilla was also top notch. Jackfruit is super hit and miss, it can come out as vegetarian-punishing mush, but this was delish. 

The meat in the carnitas was unfortunately dry, and in the Fee-Rex's opinion, too porky. Which is a shame as wrap and other fillings were great. 

The banana empanadas disappointed. Why was the Banana on the inside cold? This has come out of the deep frier people, there's no excuse.
