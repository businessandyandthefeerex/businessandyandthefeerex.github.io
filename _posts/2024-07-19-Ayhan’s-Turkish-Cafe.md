Spinach and feta gozleme  
Lamb pide  

Years ago, The Fee-Rex used to live in Perth where she discovered gozleme. It made up of a filling, often spinach and feta, sandwiched in a bready dough and cut into pieces. And it’s bloody delicious. Two years ago, we went to Perth and on our first night excitedly went searching for gozleme. What we got was a soggy disaster, an abomination not worthy of the name gozleme. And it was an awful introduction for Business Andy, who had never had the dish before and was very disappointed after literally years worth of hype. 

Fast forward to today, it is again our first night on a Perth holiday, and we are again chasing the gozleme dragon. But this time, we slayed it. Hot, fresh, squishy but not too squishy and absolutely zero sogginess. The pide dough was yum, but the filling was a bit light on flavour and tasted too much like just lamb mince. 

Shout out to Ayhan and his service. He was friendly, served us on proper plates/wooden boards with proper cutlery (not a given, the soggy gozleme place served us in takeaway boxes), gave us a bowl of accompanying sauce AND three after-dinner mentos. We appreciate the details.
