Chicken empanadas  
Jerk Pork belly  
Chips  
Macaroni cheese  

We love the vibe at Nannyâ€™s, it was chill and fun, the staff made you feel like they really wanted you there and wanted to make sure you were having a good time. The food was average to good. The empanadas had a lovely crisp shell but were a bit of a nothing in the fillings department. The pork belly had an amazing sauce but was chopped into these huge pieces of which some were literally just fat, while others were, dare we say, a bit dry. The chips were strong but the macaroni cheese, while lovely and creamy, lacked flavour.
