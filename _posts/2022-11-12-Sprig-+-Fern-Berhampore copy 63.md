Flatbread with beetroot hummus and dukkah  
Beef cheek with fried cabbage, mash, parship batons and jus  
Spiced cauliflower steak with cauliflower puree and pesto  
Peanut butter mousse and ice cream  

Oh dear, a few mistakes made tonight. Keep going like this and you'll find yourself at a 1, Victoria Tavern. Their most glaring error was describing the cauliflower steak as spiced when what they meant was spicy-as-fuck. This thing was too hot for us to enjoy, but the menu gave no warning. Yeah, it was described as "spiced" but so is a pumpkin spice latte, and a PSL isn't going to burn your mouth house down. 

The flatbread was unfortunate, it tasted like a sad supermarket refrigerator bread you heat at home then think you shouldn't have bothered. The hummus was bland and there wasn't nearly enough dukkah. The beef cheek was fatty and wasn't especially flavoursome, although the accompanying mash, jus and cabbage were all reasonable, and the parsnip batons a surprise hit. The peanutbutter mousse was a miss, too peanutty and only made tolerable by the ice cream.
