Vegetarian burger with fries  
Moroccan salad   
Churros with stout chocolate sauce  

Another strong performance from Parrotdog. The salad was the standout. We're generally nervous ordering the salads here, and for good reason as some have been clangers. But this was very nice. The kumara was soft and tasty, but there wasn't enough of it. The chickpeas were really flavourful and a good texture with a super tasty artichoke crema sauce that paired excellently. The rocket was not overbearing, just a good time all round. 

The vegetarian burger we've had many times. While the flavour continued to be good, they had overcooked the patty making it unpleasantly crisp at the edges. The churros were a new addition to the menu, they don't generally do any desserts at all. They were fantastic. Fluffy and soft, and really long. The sauce tasted good but was too thin so you could only get a limited amount on your churro, we ended up drinking the sauce at the end.
