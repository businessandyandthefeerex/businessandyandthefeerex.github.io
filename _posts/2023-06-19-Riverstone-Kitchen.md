Pumpkin soup  
Linguine with pork sausage  
Breads and hummus  
Deep fried Spanish custard with salted caramel ice cream  

When you taste a 4, you know it. While some 4s are fancy, they don't have to be. Riverstone kitchens pumpkin soup was a great example of this. From the first sumptuous mouthful it was obvious we were dealing with greatness. But it wasn't full of truffle oil or topped with gold leaf. Just simple well flavoured soup served piping hot with some fresh bread. It's something that theoretically anywhere could do, and yet most don't. 

The bread was cooked in house and it showed. Super fresh, and there were two different kinds to load with the hummus and dukkah. 

The pasta was similarly quite simple, and very nice. The pork sausage was really minced pork, and was packed with fennel, with a red wine sauce, and just enough parmesan. 

Less simple was the dessert. It was cubes of vanilla custard that had been crumbed and deep fried, served with a delicious salted caramel ice cream and sugared almonds. Unusual, but absolutely delicious, and such a refreshing mix of textures. Most desserts are so boring, but they brought something special to the table.
