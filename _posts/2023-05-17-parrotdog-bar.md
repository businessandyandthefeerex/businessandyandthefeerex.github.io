Cheese platter  
Veg burger and chips  
Market fish salad  

It's becoming a bit of a trend when we eat here, some things are quite good, but something else is just abysmal. Tonight's loser was the market fish salad, which it turns out, was code for cold beans, corn, and capsicum, with some fish and super crispy tortillas, and not enough of an admittedly quite nice sauce. The pickled onion on the top was probably the best thing about this dish. 

The cheese platter was serviceable, but they should take the brie out of the fridge ahead of time as it's quite unpleasant when it's hard. The vege burger was pretty good, excellent structural integrity and the fake meat patty was enjoyably tender.
