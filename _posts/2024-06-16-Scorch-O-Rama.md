Tofu scramble with cauliflower, kumara, potato, spinach  
Roast potatoes, haloumi, egg, smoked salmon  

Two more outstanding milkshakes later, the Batman and the Iron Man, Scorch O Rama is still a 3 overall. 

The tofu scramble was too watery, and wasn't super flavourful. The potato dish was really good, we particularly appreciated the crispy curry leaves and the perfectly cooked haloumi. While we booked ahead, we probably could have just walked in this time.
