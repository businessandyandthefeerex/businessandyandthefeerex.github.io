Swagat paneer with rice and plain naan  
Chicken pulusu with rice and chilli cheese naan  

Complimentary poppadoms - check. Fast service - check. Warm plates - no check. Despite this faux pas, we had a very good meal at Swagat India. The curries were both quite special and were different to what we've had before. They'd even sprinkled a bit of fresh coriander and spring onion on the top for a bit of razzle-dazzle. 

The plain naan was perhaps a bit too thin and overcrisp, but was otherwise serviceable. The chilli cheese naan might have gone a bit too far in the other direction, and was too plump and bready.
