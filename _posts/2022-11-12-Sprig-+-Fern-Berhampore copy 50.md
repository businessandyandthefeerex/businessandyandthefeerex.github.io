Malai kofta  
Butter chicken  
Plain naan  

The empty restaurant is a place many diners fear. If nobody else is going there, why would you? We eat at a lot of empty or near empty restaurants, and it doesn't normally phase us. But Saffron Haveli did. 

The place was definitely open - an unlocked door, a blackboard outside advertising a lunch special and an open sign on the door. The place was very large and totally empty. We tentatively entered and waited by the front. Employing a tried and tested technique, The Fee-Rex loudly dropped her keys and a man came scurrying in from the back. 

He appeared bewildered that we were there. We asked if we could have a table for lunch, and he gestured to us to sit anywhere. He didn't bring us any menus, but instead came straight over as we were sitting and asked if we wanted curry. Yes, we said. Butter chicken, korma...? he asked. In a panic we said the first two curries that came to mind and plain naan. 

Some time later they decided to turn the lights on. While we were eating they decided it was time for music. The experience made you feel like an unwelcome intruder in their space, like you were inconveniencing them by dining with them. They had a $14 lunch special going with curry, rice and naan. The portions were generous and it was great value for money. 

The curries themselves were middling. The chicken quality was pretty good, but the butter chicken sauce had a sweet tomato soup flavour to it. The malai kofta wasn't too sweet, but nor was it very flavourful. The koftas suffered from ball-of-mashed-potato-itis. It feels like a long time since we've had a good kofta. Where are the nuts, the spices, the variety?
