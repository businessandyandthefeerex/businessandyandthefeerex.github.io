Supreme pizza  
Meat lovers pizza  

Looking for a late night (8pm!) meal in Turangi. Well you're out of luck. Even the supermarket is closed! Valentino's, which says it's open til 10, closed. Burger King is open, but who's that desperate. Enter the hero of the evening, Turangi Tavern, serving meals til 8.30. 

The atmosphere was classic small town pub. Rugby on the telly, families enjoying a night out (including a kid who absolutely hated when a dessert came out for him covered in candles and a loud rendition of the birthday song), pokies and handles. The pizzas matched this atmosphere. The base was the best bit, crispy, thin but not too thin, we wonder if they'd handmade it. The meat lovers was pretty good, sweet and BBQ-ish as is to be expected, with a good cook and the right amount of cheese. Unfortunately, the supreme had gone overboard on the cheese and underboard on the cook.
