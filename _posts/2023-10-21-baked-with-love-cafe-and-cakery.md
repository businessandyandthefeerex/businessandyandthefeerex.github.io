Pumpkin tart  
Pork belly bao buns  
Lemon curd cheesecake  
Passionfruit, mango, pineapple, and banana smoothie  
Berry, banana, and date smoothie  

It's hard to follow the excellent pork bao buns of Hare and Copper just twelve hours later, it's a bit like walking on the stage after Elton John has absolutely lit a crowd on fire. But these were still good. Unfortunately, the pumpkin tart was a bit more Sad Songs, and a bit less Rocket Man. The base was definitely too dry, and the filling was a bit bland to make up for it.

The lemon curd cheesecake Crocodile Rocked. But this is really more their specialty. The cakery part of Baked With Love kind of stands out. Their specialty cakes look absolutely amazing, and the small cakes and slices in the cabinet, while not quite as impressive, look delectable. We wouldn't say smoothies were their strong suit, the smoothies we tried were average to good.
