Haloumi fries with chilli sour cream  
Korean pork belly bites  
Vegetarian lasagne with salad  
Double beef burger with chips and aioli  

Tonight Khandallah Trading Company served us two good meals, one great meal, and one absolute clanger that can burn in the pits of hell as far as we are concerned. 

Let's start from the top. The haloumi fries were exceptional. They were fried to perfection, and the sauce was chunky and flavourful. A bit of a rip-off at $17 for five fries, but when they taste this good we aren't complaining. 

To the middle of the pack. The pork belly bites were mostly very good, with the odd dry one thrown in there just to keep you on your toes. The burger had a good mix of flavours, plenty of pickle and mustard with reasonable patties too. It's a double beef burger. We are normally single-pattie folks, and feel often the double pattie just tastes like too much meat. But this one wasn't too meaty, but did suffer from excessive tallness, another downside of the double pattie. This is an unfortunate and very common problem we speculate is due to wanting to make the burger look appealing. But it's not a looking-at burger. Width not height people, width not height. 

The vegetarian lasagne was revolting. The description was as follows : "deep fried winter greens and cheese lasagne, marina sauce, fondue, basil pesto, house salad". The description should have read "CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE FRIED CHEESE CHEESE CHEESE FRIED LASAGNE CHEESE FONDUE FONDUE CHEESE winter greens, pesto, marinara sauce, house salad DRESSING DRESSING OIL DRESSING DRESSING." We fail to see a market for this product. It was near impossible to finish. Both unfortunate souls who ate this meal ended up with a sore tummy afterwards. And you couldn't even break up the cheese-fest with bites of salad, as the salad was absolutely glistening with oily dressing.
