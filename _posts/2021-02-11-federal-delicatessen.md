Griddle cake  
Cinnamon scroll  

Federal Delicatessen is cool. A lot of effort has been made to make this place look like an old New York Deli, and we felt several degrees cooler just sitting there. Likewise, the menu is very American, you can order bottomless tea and filter coffee, there's pastrami everywhere, you can get pie by the slice, and there's even a Reuben available. The breakfast menu is atypical, but this is a good thing. Reader, you may have noticed these Business Andy and the Fee-Rex don't review a lot of breakfasts. We're sick of eggs Benedict, and we're sick of knowing exactly what else is going to be on the menu before we arrive, it's always so pedestrian. The cinnamon scroll was very good, but unevenly heated, which was a shame. The griddle cake was fantastic, it came with crunchy nutty stuff, floofy cinnamon butter, a small amount of syrup (just the right amount) and some blueberry compote. All in all, the griddle cake was stupendous.
