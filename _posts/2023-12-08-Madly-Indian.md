We ate dinner here in November 2023

Lamb do pyaza  
Paneer chettinaud  
Butter naan  
Cheese naan  

While it can be hard to stand out when you're an Indian restaurant, doing the basics right can take you a long way. So while they didn't quite take us to the moon and back, truly Madly deeply Indian certainly didn't crash and burn. 

The best thing was probably the chettinaud sauce, and the worst was  the cheese naan, in which none of the promised cheddar appeared. That was Edam at best. We don't know why Business Andy keeps ordering cheese naans, they just end up breaking his heart every time.  Special shout out to Madly Indian's rice, they'd added some extra spices which really elevated it.
