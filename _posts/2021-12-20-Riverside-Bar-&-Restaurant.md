Scotch fillet with chips, carrots and asparagus  
Crumbed terakihi with new potatoes and salad  

You don't expect to find an elegant restaurant after driving past cabins, a trampoline, and a playground in a camp ground. It's just so incongruous and unexpected, but that's exactly what we found here. The restaurant is dressed up as a classy joint -  tablecloths, wine glasses on the tables and a dark colour palate. It was a nice setup, but just didn't quite fit in with the swing sets and pool outside. 

We liked the waiter, he was friendly and did a good job overall. He did forget to ask how Business Andy likes his steak, but they compensated by bringing out a steak that ranged across the piece of meat from rare to well done. Something for everyone! The meat itself was flavourful, but we wish they wouldn't stack the steak on top of the chips, it makes them soggy with meat juice. The asparagus and carrot were top notch. 

The fish was well crumbed but super fishy and the tartare was bringing no flavour. The salad was reasonable, while unfortunately some of the new potatoes were undercooked.
