Mushrooms on toast  
Waffles with banana and vanilla creme fraiche  
Banana smoothie  

Quay Cafe know how to get food out fast. Some of it is good, and some of it is really not. The mushrooms on toast were fantastic, and would qualify for a 4 on their own. But the waffles were awful. They were clearly not made in house, instead they were stodgy frozen waffles with a nasty chewy texture. Even though the vanilla creme fraiche was yum and the banana very well caramelised, you still had to eat them with the gross waffles. No coming back from that. To top it off the smoothie was a very unfortunate flavour. They seem to have used a flavoured yoghurt, maybe berry, in the banana smoothie which ruined the whole thing.
