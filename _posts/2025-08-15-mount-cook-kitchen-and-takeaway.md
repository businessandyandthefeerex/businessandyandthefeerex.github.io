Sweet and sour wontons with fried noodles  
Orange beef with rice  
Spring rolls  

The owners of Mount Cook Kitchen & Takeaway must have been attending the Dumpling'd School for Customer Repulsion, because their restaurant, with its wide open door in mid August, was cold as all hell. On the other hand, their food was piping hot and fresh out of the kitchen. And their 5 free spring rolls with $35 spend (we spent 50c over the threshold, yusssssss) was a nice touch, although these were sauceless and bland. 

The number one problem was the sauce on the orange beef. It had no hint of orange, unless you count rare bitter pieces of orange peel, and seemed to be comprised of 99% concentrated soy syrup. However the meat itself was of good quality and was crispy while not being dry. Both meals were very generously sized and you'll be full at the end of your $35. The wontons were weirdly flat, like they had come boxed in a manner which maximised wontons shipped per cubic metre. Plus they were chewy. The sauce was oversweet and the noodles under-flavoured, although we appreciated their texture and that they weren't too long.
