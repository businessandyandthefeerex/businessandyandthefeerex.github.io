Popcorn chicken    
The Smokey  
The Schnitz  

Remaining a 4 is not a small task. And the truth is that we should be paying a lot of attention to any 4 at which we dine again. Perhaps we weren't quite up to the task of re-reviewing Burger Liquor tonight, but we didn't quite leave with the same impression that they have previously had no trouble leaving. 

A big part of that is, no doubt, the change to their cocktail menu. Gone are the hard milkshakes for hard dudes, in are the standard milkshakes, shot of a spirit optional. We don't want to make it sound like we don't love that, because we do, and they were still really good, but if they used to be custom made hard milkshakes that were crafted with love and attention, with the intention for them to be boozy, well... it's just hard to compare to that if you don't have a focused and planned hard milkshake. 

The burgers were still great, we will note that the The Schnitz dropped it's guts literally everywhere, right from the first bite, be warned. The popcorn chicken was really nice though, instead of being super heavily battered they had a much lighter coating than you often see. Special shout out to the TV in the corner, tonight it was playing Kung Fu Panda and Over the Hedge. While these are a clear step down from the OG Space Jam and Jumanji that we've seen them playing before, we continue to enjoy that they are playing dope flicks for the punters. One day they'll be playing Flubber, and we'll be here for it, we'll probably just stay and watch the whole thing.
