Potato cake sliders  
Malai kofta with rice  
Plain naan  
Cheese naan  

What a mix! The Spice Room managed to serve us 4-worthy as well as 1-worthy dishes tonight. But before we talk about the food, we need to mention 2005s Crazy Frog. What's that? You weren’t expecting to hear Crazy Frog in an Indian restaurant? Neither were we. Yet for some reason, The Spice Room had chosen Crazy Frog as their takeaway phone's ringtone. And yes, the first time we heard it the Fee-Rex danced. She’s only human. But four or five phone calls later, the rosy sheen of nostalgia had worn off and we were mostly just perplexed. 

We don’t normally order an entree in an Indian restaurant as they normally are very same-same. But The Spice Room had some intriguing sounding offerings, so we decided to branch out. The potato cake sliders were a triumph. We all know a hash brown is the best thing you can put in a burger, and this slider was basically just a spiced hash brown with yummy sauce in a tiny fresh bun. Yum. The chat was interesting, we haven’t had it before and we wouldn’t be sorry to have it again. 

The same can’t be said about the regrettable malai kofta. The koftas were uninspired barely flavoured potato mush with no fun texture (where’s the nuts? More currants please!!). They were not helped by the sauce which was just sweet and bland. The rice was plain despite us asking for cardamom rice. Also, screw you charging us extra for rice. Only a dollar, but it’s the principle of the thing. The rice should be factored into the cost of the curry, the way everybody else does it. 

The naans couldn't salvage the meal. They were too doughy and the cheese one was just piles of mozzarella yet again.
