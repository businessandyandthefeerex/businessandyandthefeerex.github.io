Popcorn chicken  
Pork belly  
Orange beef tostadas  
Pork katsu sando  

We're not going to act like we're novices when it comes to eating at Dragonfly. We've been here a half dozen times at least, and with good reason, because it's bloody delicious. As such, we've tried much of what's on the menu. Unlike many upmarket joints the folks at Dragonfly don't seem to vary their offerings much. While usually we value trying new things, tonight we didn't order anything we haven't had before - after all, there isn't much left. So you won't be surprised to hear that this was a delicious meal. We know that the tostadas are delightfully orangey and sweet. That the popcorn chicken is just the right amount of gingery-spicy. That the pork katsu has the softest bread. 

Actually, we take it back. Discussing it now we're not sure we've had the pork belly before. But this too was a hit. Sticky and juicy, with a refreshing salad, this went down a treat. And as always, the cocktails were fab, although we didn't really like the China Girl (cheap apple juice?)
