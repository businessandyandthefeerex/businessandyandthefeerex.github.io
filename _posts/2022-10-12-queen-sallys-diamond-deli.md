Mini pizza with artichoke, tomato, and pesto  
Toasted spicy pumpkin, cheese, onion, and spinach sandwich   
Passionfruit, lemon, and coconut slice  

Queen Sally's is a small, quirky deli with a particular emphasis on vegetarian/vegan food. In fact, we didn't notice any options with meat, although their website says they have two meat options available at a time. Their was certainly plenty of nice looking food on offer, predominantly from the cabinet, and the place was very busy. 

We very much enjoyed the toasted sandwich, which was interesting, spicy and well toasted (in fact, the waitress said it was overtoasted and offered to re-do, but we thought it was just right). We very much didn't enjoy the pizza. There are so many good ways to do a vegetarian pizza, but this thing had missed the mark hard. The base was dry and crumbly, it was heaving with a really nasty basil pesto, some tomato that was bringing nothing to the party, and some artichoke that was embarrassed and wanted to leave early. 

The slice was really something. The flavour combinations were perfect, a lovely fluffy custardy texture, and it was really different. In fact, the whole sweet part of the cabinet looked incredible.
