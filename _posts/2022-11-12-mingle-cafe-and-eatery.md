Southern style chicken wrap  
Breakfast burger & chips  

Not a great showing. Perhaps they were just so busy with a karate ceremony in the back*, and the accompanying afternoon tea that our meals were just an afterthought. It certainly took a long time for the food to come out, especially so when you realise that we were the only people waiting for food. 

The chicken wrap was sad. They had heated the whole thing, who wants piles of hot lettuce and hot tomato? The chicken was those little boneless tenders "southern style" you buy in the frozen section of the supermarket. Miserable. 

The burger was a bloody skyscraper, there is no way they thought somebody was going to be able to bite into it. Tonnes of tomato, a beef patty, a fried egg, bacon and a dumb sausage they'd cut in half lengthways and thrown in. The best part of a cooked breakfast, the hash brown, was conspicuously absent. Take notes, Mingle, a good breakfast burger is going to be egg, bacon, hash brown, special sauce, a nice bun, and an appropriate height so that you can actually bite into it. Don't put in things that are going to cause a burger-slide like a thick layer of tomato lubrication on the bottom, and a whole freaking sausage. Jesus, it's another case where they probably never actually tried to eat the burger that they made. 

*The back half of Mingle is a karate dojo. Weird, huh?
