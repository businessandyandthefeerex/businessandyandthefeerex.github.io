Vegetarian mamak mee goreng  
Beef rendang  
Milo tarik  

It's not common to get one noticeably nice server let alone two, which was the full front of house staff at Kanama Kopi Kadai. They were a delight. Also delightful was that mamak mee goreng. Holy hell, it did everything right and then some. They cut the vegetables up small, they cut the noodles up small, spicy but not too spicy, good texture combinations, excellent flavours, and pieces of semolina fritter that blew us away. We could have eaten that dish again immediately.

The same can't be said about the beef rendang. The meat was tough, stringy, and dry. Which was a crying shame, because the rest of this dish was actually quite good, but there's just so much meat in a rendang, that you can't get past it. 

The milo was the biggest let down of the night. Much like the coffee that they serve in Malaysia, the hot drinks at Kanama Kopi Kadai come with a layer of sweetened condensed milk at the bottom of the cup. Because milo is so sweet already, the restaurant uses evaporated milk instead of the condensed milk. Fair enough, but they just didn't add even close to enough evaporated milk, this was just an expensive hospital waiting room grade milo.
