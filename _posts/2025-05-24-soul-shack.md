The Sando   
Fried cauliflower  
Boneless bone meal  

You might think that fried chicken is always going to be delicious. We, and Chickking, are here to tell you that you're wrong. Fried chicken is more often a failure than a success, so it was with trepidation that we walked into Soul Shack. And it is with our hands held high that we walked out. 

Crisp, spicy, and fresh fresh fresh. Way too many of these places you'll get a couple of items that are freshly fried, one recently fried, and one who-knows-when fried. Tonight everything was piping hot and super crisp, but not greasy. The service was also fresh, they seemed thrilled that we were there, they bought the food to our table rather than yelling at us from the counter, and all these little things count. 

Speaking of little things counting, what happened to your fizzy drinks? We ordered a L&P, and our friends ordered a coke. They were both somehow flat, and the coke had a weird melted cola ice block taste. While we are nit picking, the bun for the burger should have been toasted, but kudos on the structural integrity. 

Back to the compliments, we'd like to congratulate Soul Shack on their fried cauliflower. How was it so crisp on the outside, yet so soft on the inside? And the accompanying pickles were inspired. It was spicy, but manageable, and the dipping sauce was welcome. Also, the fries which were covered in a very tasty sprinkle were also spot on. And thanks for offering a range of spice options, and even offering to tone down the spice if it was too much when we got it. That was very kind of you.
