Guacamole with totopos
Fried chicken
Pulled pork taco
Lamb taco
Smoky beef taco
Fried cauliflower 
Chimichangas s'mores

Another strong showing from Mexico tonight. Only two items didn't measure up. The lamb taco, which sounded delicious on the menu, was dry and half the ingredients were imperceptible. The chimichangas s'mores sounded outstanding, but were mostly empty space and marshmallow. Also, giving us a spoon wouldn't have killed you, how were we meant to eat the ice cream. 

The smoky beef taco was the best of the night, juicy and super sweet. The totopos were thin and salty, just right for dipping. The pulled pork taco was also very good. It was absolutely dripping with juice, careful with your nice clothes. 

Note the above list of dishes is way too much just for two people. Two people probably need about 4.
