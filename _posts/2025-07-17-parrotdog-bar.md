Crispy fried chicken bites  
Sticky fried cauliflower  
Kumara gnocchi with cashews, pesto and garlic foccacia  
Churros with stout chocolate sauce  

Back at Parrotdog for the first time in months (it's our regular quiz joint) we were excited to try all new menu offerings. Parrotdog delivered with their all time best showing. 

We are no strangers to their excellent fried cauliflower, but this new sticky version is a welcome change. The chicken was also excellent, crispy and fresh, tender on the inside. Both cauli and chicken came with great sauces plus pickles and pickled onion. 

The gnocchi was good, but overshadowed by the sensational foccacia which hogged all the limelight. Sweet lord there were entire cloves of roast garlic in there. Soft, herby, delicious. 

The churros themselves were fresh, fluffy and not greasy, if a little comically long. The stout sauce was good in flavour but a bit thin in texture.
