Vegetarian pad Thai  
Beef massaman curry  

Like Indian, Thai is another cuisine where it's hard to stand out. Nahkon Thai has tried to up their game through the addition of photogenic extras to their meal that you wouldn't want to eat. Orange slices on your pad thai? No thanks. How about lettuce? Hell no. We are yet to meet somebody who wants to eat a warm piece of lettuce. These changes may hold some visual appeal, but food is made for eating and we weren't impressed. The rest of the dish was okay, it had a good mix of vegetables, and the flavour of the noodles was good. 

Likewise, the massaman curry was pretty okay if perhaps a bit overly sweet. It was really let down by underdone potatoes, and meat that was far too chewy.
