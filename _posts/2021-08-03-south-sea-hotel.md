Mexican bean nachos  
Battered fish, chips and coleslaw  

Despite being a Tuesday night during the off-season amidst a pandemic which precludes all international tourism, the South Sea Hotel was pumping. The food and drink was flowing, and everybody seemed to be having a good time. They undoubtedly benefit from being the only restaurant on Stewart Island that's open during winter, and frankly food-wise they had kind of phoned it in. Starting with the positives, the fish was fresh and tasty in a well-cooked batter that wasn't too oily. The chips were fine, but the coleslaw was a real snore, just cabbage and onion with no real flavour. And where's the tartare! The vegetarian nachos were pretty miserable. Completely flavourless bulk pack corn chips, under-seasoned bean mix and too much cheese. Points for the guacamole though.
