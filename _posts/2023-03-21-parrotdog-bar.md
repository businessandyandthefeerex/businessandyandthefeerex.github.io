Mushroom, hummus and avocado sandwich with chips  
Chicken salad sandwich with chips  
Pitas and hummus  

A bit of an unfortunate showing from Parrotdog tonight. The pitas were disasterously over-crisp, they shattered in your mouth and the hummus wasn't very flavourful. The chicken sandwich was very large, but the chicken itself was bland and by half way through you were definitely over the experience. The mushroom sandwich was better in the taste department, but had huge slices of avo and huge whole portobello mushrooms which caused structural issues and was difficult to bite. The chips were the highlight, but given that they were just ordinary shoestring fries with tomato sauce, that's not really praise.
