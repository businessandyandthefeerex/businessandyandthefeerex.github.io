Classic fried chicken bowl  
Single beef burger  
Waffle fries with gochujang mayo  

Billed as an innovative, mouthwatering cross between Nashville-style and Korean-style fried chicken, the reality is that it's just a middling fast food joint in an underground food court. While the chicken itself was actually quite good, everything else in the bowl was just a huge slog. And it was all made worse, or at least much harder to eat by the awful wooden fork.

The burger was okay overall, although the bun was far too dry, and the same for the patty. At least the sauces were pretty good. 

The waffle fries were the complete opposite experience, good waffle fries, but awful sauce. It was supposed to be gochujang mayo, but that flavour was indiscernible, it may as well have just had a few drops of tabasco sauce in it for all we could taste.
