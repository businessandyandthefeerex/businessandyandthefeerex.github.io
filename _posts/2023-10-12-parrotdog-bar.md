Fried cauliflower  
Vegetarian burger  
Broccolini salad  
Bean salad  

Broccollini salad hrough and finished the updated Parrotdog menu again, sampling two different salads tonight. The broccolini was marvellous, it had a sesame dressing which tasted great and puffed rice for a fun texture. Very happy to have that again. 

If someone makes us eat the bean salad again, we will die. It was simply awful. The veggies were raw and cold. The tomatoes were squashy and unwelcome. The ricotta was just ricotta. It's hard to picture anybody enjoying this salad. 

Despite this terrible offering, they've again achieved an overall rating of 3.
