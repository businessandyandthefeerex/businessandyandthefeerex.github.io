Pork katsu sandwich  
Chorizo bubble & squeak  

An absolutely triumphant showing today, with barely a foot set wrong. The sando came with a little bowl of sauce, which while nice, was a bit difficult to manage. We tried dipping the sandwich in it, that wasn't quite the move, we tried spreading the sauce on top, but that just gave us sticky fingers. One of the great mysteries of our time. 

Otherwise the sandwich was fantastic, we really appreciated that the little katsu cakes were perfectly sandwich shaped, and the whole thing held together nicely. They'd really thought about how you were going to eat it, and had considerately cut it in half, so despite being a bit tall it was a very manageable sandwich. 

We couldn't identify all the ingredients in the bubble & squeak, but we can identify that they worked together well and were delicious. The poached egg was a good accompaniment and perfectly cooked.
