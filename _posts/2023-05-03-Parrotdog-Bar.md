Caesar salad with haloumi added  
Fried cauliflower with pickles  
Beef burger  

In a shocking twist, just a few short weeks after we issues our first ever Overall Ratingâ„¢, Parrotdog has changed their menu. With a new menu comes a new opportunity to impress us. Have they read our review? Everything we panned is gone, but to be fair, most of the old menu is gone. 

Fried cauliflower is a welcome addition to any menu, and Parrotdog's is absolutely solid. Watch out, it is quite spicy though. The beef burger was dry but otherwise capable. Unfortunately, the caesar salad was just plain bad. It was absolutely swimming in dressing, with a literal puddle of the stuff left in the bottom of the bowl. There was far too much cos, and the onion, olives, and parmesan were far too sparse. The haloumi was nice, shout out to Zany Zeus, but it was an expensive add-on, and didn't salvage this tragic dish.
