Fried chicken nibbles with chips  
Orange beef with rice  

Alasia Seafood is a suburban takeaways that does fish & chips, Chinese, and fried chicken. They also offer dine-in and may we say they did better than expected in that regard. The tables were clean. The table service was very good. The staff were friendly. They provided sharing plates and bespoke cutlery. 

The orange beef was made with good meat (on the orange beef scale) and it was piping hot and crispy. There was plenty of rice, but the sauce was so-so. The chicken was crazy salty and the batter wasn't flavourful (unless you count salt as a flavour). It was superbly crispy, very hot and fresh, and not too greasy. The chips were middling. 

If we could offer some advice, pop on a radio Joe (or is it Alasia...?) Your dine-in customers would like to break the silence / kitchen noise up a bit, and I'm sure your takeaway customers, which is most of your customers, would appreciate it too.
