Salt & pepper squid salad  
Kumara loaded fries  
Chilli cheese burger  
Strawberry milkshake  
Caramel milkshake  

Pauly's Diner continues to impress. The chilli cheese burger was sumptuous and the loaded fries very tasty (thanks blue cheese sauce). However, when you're at the top there's only one way to go, and we do need to issue a couple of warnings. The shakes, while very good, were not as good as last time. They were less thick, particularly the strawberry one, and that really detracted from the experience. Also, the squid salad had made the cardinal sin of being severely overdressed, plus the squid was on the chewy side. You've held onto your 4 rating Pauly's, but do be careful. We'll be back.
