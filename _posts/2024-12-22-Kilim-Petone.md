Zucchini and carrot fritter kebab  
Chicken on chips   
Tiramisu  

Nearly 3 years later, Kilim is still doing a great job. The zucchini and carrot fritter was really flavourful and went great in the kebab. Also, kudos for the distribution of sauce and lack of a soggy bottom, the end of the kebab was just as nice as the start and middle. 

The chips were crispy and had a nice spice sprinkle on them. However, the meat was on the dry side and the whole thing was under-sauced. Meat on chips is also about sauce on chips, don't you know this? There's really no excuse to be eating dry chips when the meat is gone. 

And talk about value with the tiramisu. For $9 it was at least twice the size that we had expected. The quality was reasonable but not exceptional.
