Sourdough with oil and balsamic  
Fish tacos  
Fish and chips  

Hotties is a more upmarket establishment than its name would suggest and has a lovely location right by the beach. The sourdough was a triumph. While not baked on site, it is purchased from a local bread maker and was clearly very fresh, served in thick, perfectly toasted slices with quality oil. Yum. 

The fish tacos put in a solid performance too. Unfortunately, the fish from the fish and chips suffered from batter-tastes-like-the-fryer-itis, which is a terminal condition. And don’t think the flavour could be masked by the tartare, as there wasn’t nearly enough of it. The chips were great though, fresh with a nice seasoning, but could have done with some sauce too.
