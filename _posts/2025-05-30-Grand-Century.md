Orange beef  
Chicken cashew nut in a basket  
Rice for two 

In a basket you say? Chicken cashew nut can be a bit of a boring dish, but if it comes in a cute basket, then maybe there might be more to it. We waited with bated breath for our dishes to turn up. All the while, our core temperatures dropping in their cavernous, icy dining space. 

It turns out that the basket was made of crispy fried noodles, they had plonked it on a plate, filled it with food, then poured some sauce over the whole thing. Sauce that oozed out the bottom a bit, softening the base of the noodle basket, and forming a little lake. Great presentation. Eating the noodles was quite fun at first but rapidly wore thin, especially when it came to the dry peripheries of the basket. The chicken cashew nut inside the basket didn't quite manage to wow us, unfortunately, it was just a bit bland, but there were lots of cashews.

The orange beef was really good. Crispy and flavourful, but with perhaps a bit too much dry chilli. We would have preferred it to be a bit more orange-forward, but it was definitely above average. 

Overall everyone working there was lovely, they had a great rapport with a bunch of regulars which we like to see, and several staff got together to enjoy a meal of thier own just behind us (the table closest to the heater, we noted). There was quite a large gap between our first and second meals arriving, but we needed to work out how to eat the basket so the time wasn't wasted.
