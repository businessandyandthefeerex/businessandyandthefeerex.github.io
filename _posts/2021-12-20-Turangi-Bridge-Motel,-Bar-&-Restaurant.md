Venison pie with chips  
Vegetable stack  

What a venison pie. Excellent pastry, excellent gravy, excellent chips, and two excellent sauces. The meat was a bit dry, but that was the only misstep. 

While a lot of effort had been put into the stack, it didn't quite work. The heart of the stack was a feta and spinach patty that was good at first, but became a bit tiring. The stack had quite a lot going on, and all the ingredients were fresh. It featured a fried tortilla or perhpas it was a poppadum, either way it was fun but a bit greasy. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but about a third of the way through, this dish became a burden, two thirds of the way through, the Fee-Rex started to wonder if she'd finish it. In the end, Business Andy had to jump in to maintain our membership to the clean plates club. We can't afford to have another LA Bakery & Coffee Lounge incident so soon afterwards.
