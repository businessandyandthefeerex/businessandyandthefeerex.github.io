Mince & cheese pie  
Cookie caramel slice  
Pulled pork burger with chips  
Banana smoothie  

Time for food cafe is doing an okay job, but they’re not excelling. The banana smoothie was a hit on flavour and coldness, but too thin on texture. The cookie caramel slice was perfectly edible, but actually a bit sweet and cloying. We were impressed by the pie, including their ingenuity reheating it in a toastie press which produced a surprisingly good heat distribution and even some crispness. The biggest letdown was the burger and unsalted chips. There wasn’t much pulled pork in the burger, the main meat was an uninspired beef patty. But the biggest problem was the structural integrity, which was catastrophically unstable. You could not eat this thing with your hands, stuff was sliding out everywhere. So we abandoned that and went to the knife and fork approach, but even this was very challenging. Plus now you’re not getting the true flavour profile as you can’t get everything in one forkful.
