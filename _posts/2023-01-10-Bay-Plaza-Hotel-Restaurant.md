Nut crusted fish with new potatoes, green beans, spring onions and olives with butter sauce  
Chicken burger and chips  

There is something woefully sad about an empty hotel restaurant. Phil the duty manager was a true delight, but the place smelt like a bus and we were the only ones there. We've experienced this in other failing restaurants and cafes, where the emptiness itself fills the space and you feel embarrassed just walking in. Phil asked us which room we were from - it is clear he understands nobody who isn't staying at the hotel would choose to dine there, especially with so many other restaurants in walking distance. 

After a long wait, the fish was actually pretty good. The nut crust was interesting, the fish fresh and well cooked. The salad of beans and olives was weird but surprisingly pleasing. They should ease up on the butter sauce. The chicken burger was a bummer. All the ingredients were clearly the cheapest they could find and an over-sweet mango chutney was pretty much all you could taste. 

Our advice to you, Bay Plaza Hotel Restaurant, is just give up. You're surely losing money. Switch to breakfast only, maybe a bar with some bar snacks in the evening, and just let your dinner service roll over and die.
