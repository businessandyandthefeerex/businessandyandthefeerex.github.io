Pan fried terakihi with roast potatoes, beans, tomato and mushroom and a creamy sauce  
Hash brown stack with poached eggs, hollandaise, bacon, avocado and tomato  
Banana smoothie  

The adzuki bean is what red bean paste, common in Asian baking, is made of. And just like biting into a bun and finding it full of red bean paste, this Cafe left a bad taste in our mouth. The decor and the generic classical-esque music both needed a refresh, although the service was prompt and friendly. 

The real problem was the food. The banana smoothie had been made with berry yoghurt which totally overrode every other flavour. The fish was definitely not fresh. It was extremely dry and curling at the edges. The roast potatoes were the best of it, while the rest of the veggies were forgettable. 

The hash browns were insanely overdone. They were beyond crispy, super brown and very unpleasant. Also left too long in the deep fryer was the bacon, which shouldn't have been in the deep fryer in the first place. It was dry as a bone, full on jerky. Tasted like it was time to change the fryer oil too. The eggs were appropriately poached, but inadequately drained. The hollandaise was nice, but we could have done with more. Overall it looked like something a kid would make for mothers day.
