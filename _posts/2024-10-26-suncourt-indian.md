Shahi paneer  
Butter naan  
Cheese naan  

Suncourt Indian isn't part of a food court, but it has that vibe. There are bain-maries which is always concerning, however we were pleased to see that our food was made fresh. Why did they put a couple of bits of grated cheese on top of the curry? We're not quite sure. The shahi paneer was way too sweet, and the paneer was cardboardy, but we appreciated the generous serving of rice and the friendly service. 

The cheese naan was hot and fresh with a pleasant texture. As per usual, Business Andy was disappointed yet again by the presence of mozzarella, nobody knows why he continues to order cheese naans. The butter naan was a bit dry in some places and thick in others, it was only okay overall.
