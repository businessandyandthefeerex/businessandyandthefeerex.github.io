Spanakopita and salad  
Haloumi, Turkish bread, falafel  

Kilim was doing a roaring trade, and we can see why. Everything was fresh and tasty, and came out nice and fast. The falafel was controversial - it was different to normal, being green rather than yellow inside. In The Fee-Rex's opinion it was superior to normal falafel, less grainy and a nicer flavour. Business Andy felt that normal falafel would have been preferable.

The spanakopita was very light, with excellent filo, and a great flavour. There were a few somewhat forgettable sides accompanying the spanakopita, but the spanakopita was very much the star of the show.
