Okonomiyaki  
Poutine  
Roast eggplant with Szechuan sauce and edamame beans  
Gyros  

Frankly, we're disappointed that two years later, the service hasn't improved. We sat with our empty plates for too long, forgot to bring a drinks menu when we asked, and then forgot to come and actually take a drinks order after we flagged down a second waitress to finally get a drinks menu. We had to ask for more water, even though the empty bottle was sitting right on the end of the table, and on the whole, the service left us feeling not super well cared for. They were friendly, but quite inattentive. 

Fortunately the food was pretty good. The two starters, the okonomiyaki and the poutine were excellent, in fact. After a great start though, the two mains were a bit pedestrian. The whole eggplant dish was very uniform in texture, which made it a bit dull. And the gyros was similarly just a bit boring. Nice enough, but not outstanding.
