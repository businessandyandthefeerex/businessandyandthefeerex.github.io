Bacon cheeseburger with chips  
Island fries  

Captain Andy, you salty dog, you did it again. On a rainy night, we found ourselves out of other options and forced to dine once more at the Captains table. What a disaster. While the food was better, the overall experience was a red hot mess. 

Heaps of the menu was unavailable - we had to order six items before we found two that were in stock. The wait was well over an hour. When we went to get the food, there’s was tonnes sitting around on the pass and the vibe was frazzled. 

That said, congratulations are in order here. The chips tonight were an improvement on their previous offering. That’s not saying much as last night’s chips were genuinely some of the worst we’ve ever had. Nonetheless, tonight they were warm (but still not hot), and were not floppy. They were even all shoestrings this time around; last night we were served a perplexing mix of shoestring and thick cut. 

The burger suffered from the same structural integrity problems as last night, plus it lacked flavour. They’d also slipped in a slice of unwelcome tomato, which was not on the menu. 

The island fries were enjoyable. A fun mix of tropical root vegetables served with a couple of nice sauces. The novelty factor was helping them out here, and we could have done with more sauce, but these were the best the Captain has served so far. Actually that’s not true, we highly recommend the “Coffee Me Baby” cocktail.
