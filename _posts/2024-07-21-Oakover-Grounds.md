Fried chicken burger with chips  
Pumpkin salad  

This is some of the fastest food service we’ve ever had. We’re talking Thai House Express levels of speed. We could see our cocktails being made behind the bar straight after ordering, yet somehow our cooked meals still got there first. How, you might ask? By doing everything quite poorly. 

The fries and the pumpkin were both warm, but not hot. Some pieces of pumpkin were also undercooked. The salad was crazy oily, and while there was a lot of flavours, they didn’t necessarily all meld together in a pleasant way. The salad was a bit oversized as well. 

The burger wasn’t great. The chicken itself was okay, although a small piece of gristle was found. The bun disintegrated immediately, the bacon was too thick and the cheese could have done with some melting. Overall, we’d rather have waited a bit longer and got something worth eating.
