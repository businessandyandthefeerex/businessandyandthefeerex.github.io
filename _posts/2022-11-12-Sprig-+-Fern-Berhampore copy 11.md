Roast vege salad  
Vege burger and chips  

How much not-roast-vege can you include in a roast vegetable salad before it isn't a roast vegetable salad anymore? Philosophers have pondered this question for centuries. 30%? 50? Where is the line? 1841 decided to test the limits. We estimate tonight's dish to have been 20% roast vegetables at the absolute most. 

The kumara, pumpkin and potato were actually roasted. The carrot, an obvious roast vege choice, was in unpleasantly large chunks and definitely boiled. Then there was the broccoli and cauliflower. What were they doing there in the first place? Not every veg goes with every veg, 1841. They seemed like they had been boiled then charred. The rest of the meal was green salad stuff - lettuce, cucumber, radish, cherry tomatoes - plus pomegranate arils and pine nuts. Absolute mountains of it. As proud members of the clean plates club we finished the meal, but we sure didn't enjoy doing it. 

It may sound harsh, but in terms of its construction, the burger was abominable. The incongruous fried egg spilled out everywhere, the jackfruit fell out, the bun tore in half, and the giant sheets of lettuce (including the stalk) pulled out everything else at the first bite. The Fee-Rex, as the sad recipient of the mangled remains of what used to be half a burger, had no choice but to use a knife and fork. Shameful.
