Pork belly and brie ciabatta  
Cheese scone  
Tan slice  

We would eat cakes and slices at Courthouse Cafe all day long. The cabinet was huge and all looked delicious, the menu sounded pretty good too but it was not a large menu at all. The cheese scone tragically came with refrigerated butter, and not enough to boot but it was otherwise very nice. The pork belly ciabatta was, unsurprisingly as it came out of the cabinet, delicious, if perhaps a little bready. You may have had your grandmother's tan slice in the past and think little of it, bless her she's just trying to make you baked goods that won't send you to an early grave. This tan slice was nothing like that - decadent AF with a huge midsection of caramel, nice biscuit base and crumbly topping. One thing to note about the Courthouse Cafe is that it is not open at the weekends, so if you are planning to visit, you'll need to work around that.
