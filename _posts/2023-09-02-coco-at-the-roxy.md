CoCo at The Roxy is a restaurant attached to a cinema. Unlike most cinema restaurants, this one is actually good. The vibe was nice, the menu interesting, and the service exceptional. Yes, sometimes you can hear rumbling explosions from the latest action movie, but this doesn't detract from the experience. 

The food was good across the board, not a failure amongst the bunch. Even the parsnip, which we normally hate, was actually very nice. The fried feta was particularly fun. It had a lovely texture, a mild and simple but enjoyable flavour, and it was something different. We were excited by the dessert menu. They had 3 desserts and they all sounded great, unlike most restaurants which all have the same 6 desserts of which you want none. The desserts didn't quite deliver in the same way as the mains, but we still liked them enough.
