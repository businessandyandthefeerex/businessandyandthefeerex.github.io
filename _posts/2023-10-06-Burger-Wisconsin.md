Charlie Brown burger  
Vegan hemp burger  
Hash sticks  
Caramel milkshake  

The randomiser was in force even more than usual for this meal. Burger Wisconsin (albeit a different branch) is a takeaway destination of ours where we are working through the entire menu using the random number generator. So tonight we selected not just our destination but our meals at random. 

Overall we were fairly pleased, Business Andy more so than the Fee-Rex. The Charlie Brown was the strongest burger. It's chicken with satay and was powerfully saucy. The vegan hemp burger was a pleasant surprise. Having never had a hemp patty before, we were expecting a smushed-up-chia-seeds-lumpy-and-green vibe, whereas what we got was essentially pretend meat, and a pretty good imitation we may add. The jalapenos bought some heat while the cranberry sauce bought the sweetness and the overall combination was enjoyable. 

The hash sticks were over-done and a bit oily. Luckily they're still fried potato so how bad are they really going to be? The milkshake sucked. We've had their milkshakes before as takeaway and didn't approve them, but Business Andy went rogue and ordered it anyway, foolish lad.
