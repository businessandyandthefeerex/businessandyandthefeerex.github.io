Pork belly tacos  
Tofu and mushroom bao buns  

Don't let the name fool you, Mr Glen's is a taphouse but not a tapas bar. Their 'tapas' were things like chips, garlic bread, wings. By that definition, Lone Star is a tapas bar. 

Mr Glen's menu was large, and we appreciated the funny names (our pork belly tacos were officially called "Damn That's Hot", even though they were mild at most). But the food was only so-so. The pork belly had good flavour, and the tacos were generously filled, but the belly itself was too dry. Similarly, the bao buns were generously stuffed, but the buns themselves were too thick and the dish lacked flavour.
