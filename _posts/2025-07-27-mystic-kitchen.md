Spinach & feta roll  
Chicken, chipotle & cheese quesadilla  
Apple pie  

Mystic Kitchen is a cafe with a funky old scuffy wooden furniture vibe, the indoor tables were made of those big wooden cable spools and the decor was, to use the Fee-Rex's mum's terminology, "shabby chic". They had a great looking cabinet and it was hard to choose what to have. 

We were pleased with all our selections. The spinach & feta roll had lovely pastry, a great texture to the innards and came with a killer relish. Cafe relish is very hit and miss - some are watery creations that aren't bringing anything and get paired with absolutely everything. While the same relish came with both our savoury dishes, it was a great compliment to both. Homemade? We think so. 

The cheesy quesadilla was big on cheese. Too big on cheese, and you know it must be cheesy if we're saying that. While we like cheese as much as the next guy, at this point the cheesiness was detracting from the other flavours, which was a shame as the chipotle and herbs were really nice. 

The apple pie was more of an apple slice shaped into the form of a pie. The 'crust' wasn't pastry, instead was a sort of baked sponge situation. While not unpleasant, it isn't as good as pastry. This is a shame because the apple was well stewed and spiced, yes the odd thicker apple slice was a little firm but that's better than the other way where it's a pile of mush. Also it had custard in it (!!) which was extremely welcome. Top it off with some cream and we were having a great time. 

Heads up, Mystic Kitchen has two locations. We went to the Strathmore at peak time on a Sunday and were fine. But we have been turned away from the one on Tory Street on a Saturday lunchtime before because they were full, so beware.
