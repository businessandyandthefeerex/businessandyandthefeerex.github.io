We ate lunch here in November 2024 

Strawberry milkshake  
Jackfruit sliders  
Polenta chips  
Garlic bread  

Let us tell you what we don't appreciate. Lies. Restaurants who claim a quality or nature of ingredients that makes them sound fancy, tricks you into ordering, then doesn't deliver. How would you like to try a strawberry milkshake made with strawberry ganache? Sounds pretty good doesn't it? So you could colour us disappointed when we saw with our own eyes the waiter pumping some kind of bottled syrup into our milkshake. Also, lies on lies, where was the coleslaw and aioli in the sliders? Hanging out with the strawberry ganache in imaginary-land probably! 

The highlight of the meal was the garlic bread. It was hot and fresh with plenty of garlic butter and a lovely roasty garlic flavour. But enough of the compliments, let's talk about the polenta chips. Perhaps they had been fried too long, perhaps they were just cheap old frozen polenta chips, but either way they were dry as a fortnight of Sundays and while you could see the rosemary, you certainly couldn't taste it.
