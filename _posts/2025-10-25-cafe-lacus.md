Mushroom arancini ball  
Kumara and feta crepe cup  
Coffee walnut slice  
Banoffee shake  
Biscoff shake  

This cafe is part of a complex which has popped up recently near the airport, with a few eateries, a shower/laundry station, and a bunch of time-filler entertainment (mini golf, trampoline park etc). And they serve bad food and even worse drinks. 

We’d only want to eat one of our five items again, so let’s start with that positive. The crepe cup was quite a fun dish (a crepe moulded into a muffin tin, filled then baked), it was sweet and flavourful, the pumpkin seeds provided good crunch, and it even went ok with the salsa which we suspect comes smeared on every savoury cabinet items plate. The arancini ball wasn’t so good - it didn’t go with the salsa, and it just wasn’t quite right, it was hard to put your finger on the exact issue, we are forced to conclude that everything about it was wrong. 

We have no problems identifying the laundry list of issues with the milkshakes and the slice which were all abysmal. The shakes had great sounding flavours and we were excited. But they were thin, had a mountain of extremely cheap cream on top, and the biscoff one wasn’t even cold. It at least had biscoff flavour, unlike the banoffee which was just a banana milkshake in a cup that had some cheap caramel syrup drizzled down the sides. But these were delightful compared to the walnut coffee slice, which was so bad we didn’t finish it. The slice had a very thick base layer with a gross flavour and unwelcome raisins. The top had an icing texture but not in a good way. Don’t worry, as members of the clean plates club we took it home, cut it up small, then doled it out during a long drive the next day where it was hoped the lack of choice and travelling boredom would make it more acceptable (it didn't).
