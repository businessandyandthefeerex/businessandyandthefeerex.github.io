Pumpkin and potato croquettes  
Pork belly skewers  
BBQ jackfruit quesadillas  
Fried chicken  

In the past we've really enjoyed jackfruit, and would even suggest that it's a good substitute for traditional meat filling in a quesadilla, being most similar to pulled pork. Unfortunately the jackfruit was a bit underwhelming, and there was no discernable BBQ taste. The chicken was a bit too spicy, but because they were dusted with chilli some pieces were much spicier than others. The croquettes were great, and were really crunchy on the outside. The Fee-Rex doesn't normally like pork belly, but these skewers were exceptional. They were sticky, sweet, and very juicy, frankly we could smash some more of them right now.
