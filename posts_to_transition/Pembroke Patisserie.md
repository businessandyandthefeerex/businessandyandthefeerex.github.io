We ate breakfast here in August 2023

Caramel tart

Almond, ginger, and pear tart

Berry Danish

Orange and almond scroll

Maple tea

Tucked away five minutes out of Wanaka, there is an excellent bakery. The locals all know, and the entrance is a cramped snake of expectant patrons. They only have about 8 tables so be prepared to sit outside or take away. 

The food was from excellent to good, with the caramel tart perhaps being the best offering. And the novelty winter tea was also excellent. The Fee-Rex is not much of a hot drink drinker, but she made an exception for this. 

It was the attention to detail which particularly impressed us. Everything is made lovingly on site, and you can watch them doing it through their viewing window. They even made a little meringue kiss to go on the side of every hot drink. Everything in the expansive cabinet looked delicious and changes day to day. Its the kind of place you could eat for a week and still have new things you wanted to try.
