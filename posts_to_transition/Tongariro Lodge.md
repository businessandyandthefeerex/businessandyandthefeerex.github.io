We ate dinner here again in October 2024 

Flatbread with hummus and harissa seed oil

Honey roasted carrots 

Cauliflower steak

Fries with truffle aioli

Halloumi, grapes and chorizo 

Fried chicken with wasabi mayo and sweet soy 

Burnt New York style cheesecake with parmesan and yuzu 

What a glow up. It's hard to believe that 3 years ago we slapped this place with a 2 after being served one of the worst fish dishes of all time (perhaps it's a three-way tie with White Horse Inn and LA Bakery & Coffee Lounge). Tonight, they have achieved our highest accolade, the coveted 4 rating. 

While Tongariro Lodge is not a tapas restaurant, tonight our group of 4 chose to order a bunch of plates and share them round. There wasn't a dud in the bunch. The halloumi, grapes and chorizo wasn't particularly exciting, but it was tasty. Perhaps the chicken itself could have had a bit more excitement in texture or flavour, but it was well compensated by two delicious sauces. 

Then we come to the stronger dishes. The flatbread came with a great hummus and was super well laminated and piping hot. The honey roasted carrots had a lovely honey flavour and were cooked just right. But two dishes stood above the rest. The cauliflower steak had this gorgeous flavour, the kind that makes you go 'why can't I make cauliflower like this at home, what have they done here?' The cheesecake was very strange, with parmesan for goodness sake, but it totally worked. The top was burnt like a brulee and it came with brulee'd fruit too, everything worked together. We've never had a cheesecake like this before, big points for innovation. Welcome to the upper echelon, Tongariro Lodge.

We ate dinner here again in October 2022

Breads and dips

Crispy skin salmon with potato and courgette

Mushroom, walnut, feta, and truffle oil risotto 

Broccoli with sesame and soy

Chips

Chocolate brownie

Sticky date pudding

The last time we had the misfortune of dining at Tongoriro Lodge, they crushed us with a disgusting lump of clammy John Dory, and we crushed them with a fittingly poor review. What a turnaround. This meal was really good overall, with a couple of truly great dishes sprinkled in. Unfortunately they didn't quite do enough to rise to the highest levels in our rating system, but they were knocking on the four door. 

The bread was excellent, just delicious fresh bread with really nice dips, including a beetroot dip that was a surprise smash hit. Likewise the risotto was delicious, feta, walnut, and truffle is a flavour combo that you do see from time to time, and there's good reason for that. 

The salmon was nice, but salmon is always going to have an uphill battle to gain the approval of The Fee-Rex who doesn't really like salmon in general. They had made the courgette into tiny noodles, which was quite fun. The broccoli on the side was really nice, and there was plenty of sesame and soy sauce in the bottom of the bowl, it's a pity that they couldn't make the sauce stickier, it was a shame to leave so much in the bottom of the bowl. While the chips themselves were good, we were disappointed to see a little bowl of what was a pretty plain tomato sauce on the side when the menu said that they came with aioli. Our servers were both very friendly and did a great job, they should have spoken to this point, not just plopped it down hoping we wouldn't notice. 

The sticky date pudding was an absolute triumph, perfect in every way, the only way that it could have been improved would have been to come with a second sticky date pudding instead of the brownie that we also ordered. The brownie was more like a dry chocolate cake than a brownie, which is not what you want, especially when the other dessert was just so moist.

We ate dinner here in January 2021

John Dory on Israeli couscous with salsa 

Lamb rump, roast root veggies with red wine jus 

This fish was the worst meal we have had in a long time. Bearing in mind that this establishment is part of a fishing lodge, you'd think they would know how to make a tasty fish meal. So colour us shocked when, for forty dollars no less, we were served a tasteless, clammy lump of fish. The waiter said this was pan fried. Bull. Shit. The skin on the fish was so slimy there was no way it had been in a pan. More like boiled by the taste of things. The couscous and salsa were no help. They were flavourless so the whole thing just ended up tasting like the goo you scrape off a fish. Also, would it kill you to open a window? Upon entry the restaurant was stifling hot, and we found ourselves frantically opening windows to tempt in a breeze. It felt like they'd had a fire going in there all day. Saving Tongariro Lodge from the lowest possible rating was the surprisingly good lamb rump. It was moist, flavourful, well cooked, and the root vegetables were the perfect accompaniment.
