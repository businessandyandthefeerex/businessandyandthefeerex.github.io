We ate dinner here in October 2021

Duck thigh, with roast carrot pur√©e, roast potatoes, broccolini, and a port wine reduction

Pan fried snapper on roast potatoes with broccolini and salsa

Twenty or thirty years ago, this place would have been very elegant, but it's just starting to get a little tired. Speaking of things that are tired, we were exhausted after trying to order cocktails. Don't offer a cocktail menu if three quarters of it is unavailable, and don't reveal what's unavailable in steps like you're trying to hide something; we order cocktails, you tell us they are unavailable, we go away and regroup, order two different cocktails, you tell us that they are unavailable too. This literally happened three times until we were so broken that we just ordered an orange juice and a ginger beer.

The fish was pretty good, there was only one tiny bone left in the fillet, the potatoes were great, and the accompanying salsa and broccolini were fresh and tasty. The duck was really good, the port wine reduction that it came in was just fantastic. This was a good meal overall.
