Fish tacos

Buttermilk fried chicken with aioli

Expectations aren't high when you're eating at an airport, especially when the last airport cafe you ate at crushed all hope for the future. Imagine our shock when we were served some really nice fried chicken at the Gypsy Moth. Juicy, not too greasy, crispy on the outside, hot, and fresh. The fish tacos really didn't keep up. They were too big, you had to Sophie's Choice between a mouthful of too fishy fish or extremely bland tortilla and slaw. There was some guac and hot sauce in there, but they were such a non-event that they might as well have not been there at all. It was impossible to get everything in your mouth at the same time anyway.
