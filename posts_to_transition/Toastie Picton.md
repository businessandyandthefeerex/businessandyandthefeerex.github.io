We ate second breakfast here I'm January 2022

Ivan toastie: pastrami, sauerkraut, pickles, cheese

Custard filled donut

After our misadventures earlier that morning at London Quay Cafe, you'll not be surprised to hear that we were still in the market for breakfast. We spied a little toastie place two doors down and boy are we glad that we did. 

The menu was small but innovative, there were salmon toasties, tuna toasties, and vegan kimchi toasties to name a few, and the toasties themselves were just excellent. Great size, perfectly cooked, and it's the little details. There were four different kinds of cheese in each toastie, but there wasn't too much cheese somehow. In fact the whole thing was very well balanced, the sauerkraut wasn't overpowering, and even the pickles were in just the right quantity. Normally The Fee-Rex doesn't like either of those ingredients, but today they were welcome. 

To top it all off, the donut was fresh, soft, neither too sweet nor too big. And the vanilla custard filling was divine. 

Much like Pauly's Diner, seating is limited, and while the food is simple, it's made with care and attention. Unlike Pauly's Diner, there's a large waterfront area with plenty of seating and spectacular views of the sounds just over the road. We wish there were more places like these two, it turns out that you don't need to be a Michelin starred restaurant to serve excellent food, you can get a 4 rating from us with just fried chicken or toasted sandwiches.
