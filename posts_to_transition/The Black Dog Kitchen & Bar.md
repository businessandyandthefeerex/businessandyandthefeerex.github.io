We ate dinner here in July 2021

Black dog burger with chips

Grilled fish with lemon pepper, cherry tomatoes, chips and salad 

The Black Dog is making an effort, and it shows. Many places like this that have a number of drawcards - open breakfast til late, have a full bar, a gaming lounge and serve reasonably priced food, seem to think "a certain number of people are going to eat here no matter what, so let's just do the minimum we need to get by." Not The Black Dog. Delicious homemade beef pattie and incredible structural integrity in the burger. Genuinely fresh fish, which they've bothered to cook a way that isn't battered plus pair with a very flavourful lemon seasoning. These touches show The Black Dog is really trying to make nice food, and succeeding. It wasn't aces across the board - unusually the chips were a weak link, being a little overdone and perhaps it might be time to change the oil in the fryer. The grilled cherry tomatoes seemed more heated than grilled. And they were stingy with the sauce for the fish. But these were relatively minor complaints about an otherwise very enjoyable meal.
