Almond croissant

Chicken, leek & mustard pie 

Yes, you read the title correctly. This cafe is part of a tackle house. As in a place where fishing tackle is sold. Nestled amongst the fishing flies, rods and nets is this dinky and popular eatery. The food was pretty good. The croissant was fresh and flavourful, although perhaps a little under-heated. The pie wasn't mustardy enough, but was homemade with decent pastry, no sog, and yummy filling. 

Bookings recommended, not actually sure if they take bookings, but if they do we recommend it.
