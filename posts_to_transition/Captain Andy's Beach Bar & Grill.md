We ate dinner here again in May 2023

Hawaiian chicken burger with chips

Coconut noodle salad

Captain Andy doesn’t seem to care much that such bad food is being served on his watch. We don’t even know why we keep coming back. Okay scratch that, we know exactly why we keep coming back. It’s because he’s the only food for miles in every direction, and it was raining, and we were without transport. 

This seems to happen where there is a captive audience, where people don’t have other options, there is some force that depresses good food, good vibes, and good service, leaving only ashen disappointments. Airport cafes have wronged us similarly in the past. 

At least the chips were hot this time, although it’s a bit unbelievable that it took them three tries to get it right. And the burger was the best burger of theirs that we have tried. It even matched its description this time, with no surprise ingredients. Can you believe that this is how low they have set the bar? Neither can we, and yet they still managed to limbo under it with the coconut noodle salad. It sounded really fun on the menu, but what they served ended up being very similar to a KFC coleslaw with some strips of sort-of-fresh coconut mixed through. Easily the worst thing they have served us, which is frankly impressive.

Bacon cheeseburger with chips 

Island fries 

Captain Andy, you salty dog, you did it again. On a rainy night, we found ourselves out of other options and forced to dine once more at the Captains table. What a disaster. While the food was better, the overall experience was a red hot mess. 

Heaps of the menu was unavailable - we had to order six items before we found two that were in stock. The wait was well over an hour. When we went to get the food, there’s was tonnes sitting around on the pass and the vibe was frazzled. 

That said, congratulations are in order here. The chips tonight were an improvement on their previous offering. That’s not saying much as last night’s chips were genuinely some of the worst we’ve ever had. Nonetheless, tonight they were warm (but still not hot), and were not floppy. They were even all shoestrings this time around; last night we were served a perplexing mix of shoestring and thick cut. 

The burger suffered from the same structural integrity problems as last night, plus it lacked flavour. They’d also slipped in a slice of unwelcome tomato, which was not on the menu. 

The island fries were enjoyable. A fun mix of tropical root vegetables served with a couple of nice sauces. The novelty factor was helping them out here, and we could have done with more sauce, but these were the best the Captain has served so far. Actually that’s not true, we highly recommend the “Coffee Me Baby” cocktail.

Thai vegetarian curry and rice

The works burger with chips 

Captain Andy has taken us all hostage. If you can’t be bothered leaving the resort to eat somewhere else, and the Captain knows you can’t, you lazy sods, then you’re going to have to eat what the Captain makes. Under no other circumstances could you get away with serving a meal like this. 

A basket of cold, floppy, tiny chip dregs alongside a burger which would have slid apart on the plate if not for a heroic skewer keeping it all together. The extremely poor ingredient distribution wasn’t helping; pineapple on one side, egg somewhere inside covering about three quarters of the patty. The best thing we can say about this burger is that the patty wasn’t dry at least. The curry was a-whole-nother type of sad affair. It was extremely bland and just a real bummer to eat. Providing a roti would have helped an awful lot but that was clearly beyond them. 

Sloppy work from the Captain - we’ll be organising a mutiny.
