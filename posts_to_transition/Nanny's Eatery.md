Chicken empanadas

Jerk Pork belly 

Chips

Macaroni cheese 

We love the vibe at Nannyâ€™s, it was chill and fun, the staff made you feel like they really wanted you there and wanted to make sure you were having a good time. The food was average to good. The empanadas had a lovely crisp shell but were a bit of a nothing in the fillings department. The pork belly had an amazing sauce but was chopped into these huge pieces of which some were literally just fat, while others were, dare we say, a bit dry. The chips were strong but the macaroni cheese, while lovely and creamy, lacked flavour.
