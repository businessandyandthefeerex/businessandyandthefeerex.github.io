We ate lunch here in October 2021

Battered fish bite Turkish pocket with chips

Beef burger with chips

Real talk, Hydro Eatery, a pocket holds things. A Turkish bun cut in half, toasted and sandwiched with hot contents is a burger. Additionally, a fish bite can be eaten by a human in one or two bites. Your bites were so big that they were basically a whole fish. Furthermore, the stake that you put through a burger is intended to hold everything together. If that stake touches neither of the two giant pieces of fish so that when you pick up your pocket/burger the fish falls out either side, then that stake is pretty blood redundant isn't it?!

Now that's done we can talk about the beef burger. It was merely okay, a bit dry, and was not quite hot enough to melt the cheese. But at least the whole thing didn't fall to pieces when it was picked up.
