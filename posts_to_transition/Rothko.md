Rothko

We ate lunch here in November 2023

Bread with whipped butter

Buffalo mozzarella

Beetroot ravioli

Pork loin

Situated right next to a pretty fun art gallery, and the outdoor Sculptureum, one might expect to find a pretty nice restaurant. And while Rothko does indeed have all the trappings of a fancy restaurant, they really fell down where the actual food was concerned. 

It wasn't a disaster, and they started out quite strong with a very good bread full of tasty nuts, with a really flavoursome butter on the side. But from then on they were really coasting, perhaps hoping we would be distracted by the beautiful surroundings and wouldn't look too hard at the food. 

Regular readers will already know that Business Andy doesn't particularly like mozzarella, and Rothko did little to change his opinion. Rothko had made some effort, but there just wasn't enough flavour to distract from the slog of all that cheese.

The beetroot ravioli was okay, although they'd almost drowned the whole dish in very average sauce. And the pork was very plain, but at least the meat itself was a nice cut, with no gristle or fat. Overall it felt like while what we were served was fancy, that didn't make it enjoyable. Would we want to eat this same meal again? No we would not.
