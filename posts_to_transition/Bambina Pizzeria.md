We ate dinner here in February 2024
Italian sausage and hot honey pizza
Shoestring fries with aioli

-------------------------------------------



While we were having a great night, the staff at Bambina Pizzeria were plagued by problems. It was impossible not to eavesdrop on them as they went on about needing Steve to come and take a look at the docket printer, which was apparently just churning out a zillion wrong dockets every few minutes. They tried to encourage us to dine elsewhere with that old trick "it'll be at least a 25 minute wait" which it wasn't. They obviously didn't know who they were dealing with, so we settled in to wait in their rather comfortable but wonky booth.

The fries weren't great. Not only were they overly salted, they were very short like the dregs of the bag, and the aioli was a detractant rather than an addition to the dish. However, the aioli did pair well as a dipping sauce for the crust. This was fortunate as the crust needed all the help it could get due to the disasterous toppings distribution. There was a core area of heavy sausage topping in the centre, a transition zone of just cheese around this, then a fairly broad crust. This led to an uneven dining experience to say the last. This wasn't aided by the fact that the pizza was cut into 4, not 8, slices. Strap in for your first, sausagey, flavourful mouthful. Then let your senses dull in the cheese portion, before slogging through the largest area which was the crust.
