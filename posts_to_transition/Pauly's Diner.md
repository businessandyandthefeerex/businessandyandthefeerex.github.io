We ate lunch here again in October 2022

Salt & pepper squid salad 

Kumara loaded fries

Chilli cheese burger 

Strawberry milkshake

Caramel milkshake

Pauly's Diner continues to impress. The chilli cheese burger was sumptuous and the loaded fries very tasty (thanks blue cheese sauce). However, when you're at the top there's only one way to go, and we do need to issue a couple of warnings. The shakes, while very good, were not as good as last time. They were less thick, particularly the strawberry one, and that really detracted from the experience. Also, the squid salad had made the cardinal sin of being severely overdressed, plus the squid was on the chewy side. You've held onto your 4 rating Pauly's, but do be careful. We'll be back.

We ate lunch here in October 2021

Chicken burger

Honey butter fried chicken basket

Blue cheese & hot sauce fried chicken basket

Potato fries

Banana shake

Note that this meal was shared between four people.

Wowzers. What a meal. It was so good that we're still buzzing about it days later. Everything was perfect. The shake was out of this world, how did they do it? Both the flavour and the texture were excellent, and we could both smash one right now. The fried chicken in the chicken burger was crispy and delicous, they didn't try to stack too much other stuff in the burger, so even after passing it between The Fee-Rex and Business Andy multiple times the brioche bun held together. 

The two fried chicken baskets were essentially the same perfectly cooked, succulent, crispy fried chicken with two different sauces. We can't agree on which was better, but they were both fantastic. Even the fries stood out, everything that came out of that tiny kitchen was crispy, not greasy, and had been made with love. You can really tell when someone cares about what they are producing, and Pauly cares a lot. 

There's only four tables at Pauly's Diner, so be prepared to take away if need be.
