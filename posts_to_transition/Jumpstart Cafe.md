We ate lunch here in January 2021

Pulled pork burger

Fruit salad

Lemon bread 

Liver lover juice 

Mixed berry smoothie 

The Fee-Rex used to work at an Indian restaurant, now closed, where the Jumpstart Cafe currently stands. Give our experience, we don't think this establishment will be around long either. While not ghastly, the meal was highly underwhelming. The highlight was the lemon bread, which was fresh and perfe`ctly toasted. The smoothie wasn't bad either, being reminiscent of a real fruit ice cream. The fruit salad was boring, the burger forgettable. The lowlight was the liver lover juice. The menu board described the juice as "beetroot, carrot, apple, ginger". We would suggest this description was replaced with "dirt, beetroot, far too much ginger".
