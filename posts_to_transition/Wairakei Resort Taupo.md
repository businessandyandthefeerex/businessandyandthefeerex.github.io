We ate lunch here in December 2021

Lamb burger and chips

Mushroom soup

The soup wasn't great, it was a bit oily, a bit salty, and a bit peppery. And it wasn't very mushroomey. Mushroom soup doesn't have to be super creamy to be good, but it does have to be at least a little mushroomey. The bread on the side was nice though.

The burger was quite nice. The patty was very lean but in a good way, the bun and the salad inside were both nice and fresh, and the chips on the side were very good. It was a bit unfortunate that the lamb burger didn't come with a little bowl of mayonnaise for the chips when the chicken burger did, but that really was a minor issue.
