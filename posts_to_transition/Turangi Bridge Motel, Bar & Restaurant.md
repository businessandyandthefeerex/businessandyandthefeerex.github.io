Turangi

Rating: 1

We ate dinner here in October 2023

Bread and dips 

Fried camembert with plum sauce 

Grilled fish, chips and salad 

Steak, eggs and chips 

Turangi Bridge Motel did not want us around. We showed up and asked for a table and were asked whether we had a reservation. Mate, this is a crap motel in Turangi which we can see is over half empty. No, we don't have a reservation. The people at the nearby table even said "who needs a reservation in Turangi?!" The hostess' message was clear: "Go home, we don't want to serve you." Her reservation trick hadn't worked, but she had another weapon in her arsenal. "It'll be an hours wait". Lady if you think that's putting us off, you haven't met Business Andy and the Fee-Rex. Yes, we will wait. 

True to her word, it took an hour for our mains to arrive, although our entrees were pretty prompt. The mains also didn't arrive at the same time, first we had one, then three, and finally four, and while this alone isn't going to really cause a precipitous drop in a rating from 3 to 1 by itself, all these things add up to very bad service, which can affect an overall rating. 

To add injury to insult, the food was bad. The grilled fish was soggy, the steak was overdone, leathery and gristly, the side salads were literally swimming in pools of (admittedly alright) dressing. The chips were middling, they had been stingy with the camembert, the eggs were overdone, the only things that were good in any way were the breads and the dips. 

Apparently, bookings recommended.

Venison pie with chips

Vegetable stack

What a venison pie. Excellent pastry, excellent gravy, excellent chips, and two excellent sauces. The meat was a bit dry, but that was the only misstep. 

While a lot of effort had been put into the stack, it didn't quite work. The heart of the stack was a feta and spinach patty that was good at first, but became a bit tiring. The stack had quite a lot going on, and all the ingredients were fresh. It featured a fried tortilla or perhpas it was a poppadum, either way it was fun but a bit greasy. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what went wrong, but about a third of the way through, this dish became a burden, two thirds of the way through, the Fee-Rex started to wonder if she'd finish it. In the end, Business Andy had to jump in to maintain our membership to the clean plates club. We can't afford to have another LA Bakery & Coffee Lounge incident so soon afterwards.
