Chicken breast with kale pesto and a walnut crumb

Beef short rib ragu

We were very impressed by the chicken, anyone who can take kale and turn it into something that the Fee-Rex wants to scrape up every last morsel of is a genius in our books. The walnut provided an incredible texture contrast, and it wasn't a miserable small meal, which can sometimes happen at places like this; this was an entire meal all by itself and no sides were required. The ragu was phenomenal, the little bit of chilli and the large amount of raclette in the dish left a lingering happiness in the mouth. Unconventionally, there was a live DJ at 6pm on a Sunday evening, but he was inoffensive. Props to the service and the view of the marina.
