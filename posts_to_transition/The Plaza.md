We ate lunch here in May 2023

Roast vegetables

Brownie

Banana smoothie

It takes balls to dump a plate of boiled vegetables in front of someone who ordered roast vegetables and pretend like nothing is wrong. It turns out that balls is what The Plaza has got.  

Inexplicably, the “roast” vegetable dish that they proudly labelled as “vegetarian” on their menu came with a generous bowl of meaty gravy. The keen observer could plainly see that this was the same gravy that came with the chops, and probably came from the very tray that they were cooked in. And while we’re not usually the types to question the addition of gravy, it’s a bit much to serve it as part of a vegetarian meal. 

Also inexplicably, the brownie was still Glad wrapped when it arrived without fanfare, without yoghurt or cream, without being heated, and even without a plate. It was a bit dry, but otherwise ticked the boxes that one might expect a brownie to tick.

 

The smoothie was actually pretty good, and hit the mark on flavour, texture and temperature. Easily the best thing that we tried here.
