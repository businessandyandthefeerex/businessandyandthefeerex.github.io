Fish and chips

Beef burger and chips

Manapouri Cafe & Dairy is the closest eatery to the popular Lake Manapouri jetty, so a certain amount of business is always going to come their way, and they know it. Consequently they haven't put an awful lot of effort into their menu or cookery. The cook had a panicked vibe to her, bought us out another tables meals, and then when our meals arrived had forgotten the chips. 

The highlight was the snapper which was fresh and well battered. It was served with mayo - why some places seem to think this is an acceptable substitute for tartare is beyond us. The burger wasn't bad, just carelessly made, with a bland patty and the cheapest ingredients.
