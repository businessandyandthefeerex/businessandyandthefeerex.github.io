We ate dinner here in August 2023

Oxtail ragu with broccolini and parmesan gnocchi

Breads and dips

Okay first things first, that wasn't a ragu. Second things second, that wasn't broccolini. We weren't born yesterday, you can't sneak regular plain old broccoli past us, and you especially can't if you're also charging swanky place prices. 

We were completely baffled by some of the choices the chef at Reflections had made. Why was the bread squished so flat? Why was it so oily? Why was such oily bread served with 3 different oil based dips? Also, if you were going to go to the effort of pulling the oxtail for us, why was all the gristle left in? Why even call it a ragu, when it is clearly just two piles of meat on a plate? 

It's not all bad news. The gnocchi was delicious, except the two individual pieces that were extremely salty. And while it was definitely overpriced, the meals themselves were very large, the "ragu" involved about twice the meat you'd expect. 

This place very clearly cares about one thing only, bringing tourists in and taking their money. Also, shame on you for not offering a single vegetarian main course. Okay technically there was a vegan dahl advertised on the front counter, but nothing on the menu and no mention of a special from the wait staff, so unless vegetarians saw that piece of paper on the way in, they were screwed.
