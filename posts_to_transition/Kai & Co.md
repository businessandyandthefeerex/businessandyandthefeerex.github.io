We ate lunch here in May 2023 

Fish burger and chips 

Lasagne 

Banana smoothie 

Bananas here are so much more flavourful than in NZ and it really showed in the smoothie, which also rated highly for texture and coldness. The lasagne was serviceable. It came with Watties tomato sauce on the side which was a weird pairing. Does the chef not have confidence in their lasagne? Because it shouldn’t need a sauce. The fish burger had plenty of fish in it, and it was lovely and fresh. Unfortunately it was yellowfin tuna which the Fee-Rex doesn’t care for, and the sauce distribution was uneven. But Business Andy thought it was top tier.
