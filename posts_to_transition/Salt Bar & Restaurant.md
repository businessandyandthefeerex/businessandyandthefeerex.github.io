We ate dinner here in August 2021 

Karaage chicken burger with chips 

Roast vege salad with slow cooked lamb shoulder 

It's not every day that you order an award winning burger, but that's exactly what you get here. This burger won the Dunedin Burger Society People's Choice award last year, and frankly we need to have a word. Either they didn't serve the same burger last time the judges rolled around, or there's something rotten at the Dunedin Burger Society. It's a nice idea for a burger, with edamame beans, sesame sauce, and slaw, and the bun and structure were both excellent. But the chicken was drier than the Sahara, which ruined the whole thing. Speaking as people, it wouldn't have been our choice. Onto the roast vege salad, and we feel the need to issue a warning. If you order a roast vege salad in the winter in the South Island, you will get snipped. Par-snipped. Bloody parsnip for Africa in that salad. The salad was already underwhelming - not enough dressing, an absurd amount of lamb, and lacking nuts or something that would give some texture, but to then have to wade through mountains of parsnip, it was just too much.
