Baileys creme brûlée

Affogato 


On a warm, still Hawkes Bay day, Clearview is a bloody nice place to eat. As part of a large group we got a table under cover nestled amongst the vines with a gentle breeze coming through, pure perfection. Also as part of a large group, we were happy to drink and be merry with our own company. Which is a lucky thing, as we were in for a wait. To their credit, the waiter did let us know they were extremely busy and bring out some complimentary bread. Regardless, the wait was substantial. What was worse than the wait, however, was the dripping nature with which food came out. There shouldn’t be a fifteen minute gap between the first and last meal coming out, that’s just poor kitchen management. 


Much of the food was worth the weight. We can wholeheartedly recommend the steak, arancini and particularly the profiteroles which were inventive and exciting. Unfortunately the bread and the dessert let the meal down a bit. The bread was perfectly fine, but wasn’t anything to write home about, as was the adffogato. The brûlée was the worst of the lot, with way too much baileys in it which frankly ruined the flavour.
