We ate lunch here in August 2023

Cheese roll

Tomato and basil soup

Carrot cake

We've made some pretty bad tomato soups over the years. Our Revive Kitchen cookbooks are primarily to blame, so imagine our surprise when we were served what seemed to be one of our own terrible soups. Surely they aren't cooking the same sad recipes as us, we only cook a bad soup once then throw the recipe in the bin. And yet..... 

Finishing this soup was only made possible by a generous dollop of double cream sitting on top. It might have been easier if we'd been able to taste any basil, but that was not to be today. And the bread roll that appeared to be made by them, while a nice touch, wasn't a very good example of a bread roll, and didn't make things any easier.

The cheese roll, while usually a winner was merely okay. And by the time we were finally getting to the carrot cake we were ready to be disappointed, but were pleasantly surprised by a very nice slice of cake, which was served with lots of yoghurt on the side. Mad props for that, we only wish that the cake hadn't been so cold. It really ruins a cake, nobody serves cold cake at home, why would you insist on it in your cafe?
