We ate dinner here in July 2024 

Three cheese, truffle and mushroom pizza 

Eggplant ravioli 

Something very rare happened at Sons of Naples tonight. The 4-1 split. This has only occurred a handful of times in BAATFR history, so it’s a pretty big deal. 

The eggplant ravioli was a sensation. For starters, it was a reasonable sized meal, not like sometimes when you buy ravioli and there are just two offensive little flat pastas in a huge bowl. The eggplant flavour was sublime. Eggplant can be a real hit and miss flavour, but this was truly superb, and was well balanced with cheese and tomato sauces. 

The pizza was a dumpster fire. It came with an entire 200g family packet of rocket deposited in the middle, covered in oil and bits of truffle. What the hell was that doing there? For one thing, it wasn’t a listed ingredient on the menu. For another thing, it was an insane volume of rocket. We had to eat some of it just straight as salad to try to contain it. The pizza had either no sauce, or a flavourless white sauce, it was hard to tell for reasons we will get to momentarily, but It was light on flavour to put it mildly. And yet there was clearly some kind of liquid at play. The entire centre was sodden, dripping, the texture of Weetbix that had been left in milk for an entire day, making it extremely difficult to eat. Not that you wanted to once you had tasted it, but that’s besides the point. You picked up a slice and the centre half of the triangle just slopped down into a soggy pile. We had to use forks to fold the waterlogged mess back in on itself, then stuff the whole unholy package into our mouths. Totally disgusting. 

Speaking of totally disgusting, some gratis bread showed up at the table. We absolutely love gratis bread, who doesn’t? But we have to say, if the bread is hard enough to be used as a weapon, perhaps it isn’t suitable to serve. This bread, which was probably pretty nice at one stage, had been toasted within an inch of its life. It miraculously wasn’t burned, but it was hard as rock. We didn’t know that material science had progressed this far, usually when you temper bread like this there is at least a trace of soot. Anyway you feared for your life biting into it, the risk of a shard breaking off and impaling you through your palate all the way up into your brain was exhilaratingly real.
