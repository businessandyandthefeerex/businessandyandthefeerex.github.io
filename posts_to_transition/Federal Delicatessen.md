We ate breakfast here again in July 2023

Poutine with pastrami

American hot dog

Now that we've eaten at this cool diner twice, we have been accepted into the ranks of the Cool Peopleâ„¢. Don't even speak to us if you are one of those unacceptably lame losers who would call Federal Delicatessen by it's full name, sheesh, we'll be referring to it as the Fed Deli from now on.

Fed Deli put on another good meal this morning. The poutine would have been better with more cheese curd and gravy, but it was poutine, so although it wasn't the best version of what it could have been, it was still a very enjoyable dish. 

If they had put a more interesting sausage in the hot dog, they would have had an excellent dish on their hands. As it was, with a nicely toasted bun, a delicious onion chutney, and plenty of mustard, it was really nice, only just shy of greatness.

We ate breakfast here in February 2021

Griddle cake

Cinnamon scroll

Federal Delicatessen is cool. A lot of effort has been made to make this place look like an old New York Deli, and we felt several degrees cooler just sitting there. Likewise, the menu is very American, you can order bottomless tea and filter coffee, there's pastrami everywhere, you can get pie by the slice, and there's even a Reuben available. The breakfast menu is atypical, but this is a good thing. Reader, you may have noticed these Business Andy and the Fee-Rex don't review a lot of breakfasts. We're sick of eggs Benedict, and we're sick of knowing exactly what else is going to be on the menu before we arrive, it's always so pedestrian. The cinnamon scroll was very good, but unevenly heated, which was a shame. The griddle cake was fantastic, it came with crunchy nutty stuff, floofy cinnamon butter, a small amount of syrup (just the right amount) and some blueberry compote. All in all, the griddle cake was stupendous.
