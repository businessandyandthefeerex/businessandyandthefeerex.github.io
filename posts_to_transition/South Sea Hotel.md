We are lunch here in August 2021

Fish burger and chips

Potato and celeriac soup with ciabatta

How can you serve us fish with no tartare sauce last night, then serve a fish burger replete with tartare sauce today? You clearly had some, so you can't play the "it's hard to get stuff delivered to Stewart Island" card. It was a nice tartare sauce too, and would have greatly improved last night's meal. As it happens, the fish burger with tartare sauce was quite nice, it fell apart completely but that pretty much always happens with fish burgers. They assumed that we wanted the full portion of soup, we assumed the half portion would be standard for lunch. Future diners are recommended to request a half portion unless you are extremely hungry, because this soup was huge. The flavour was pretty good, maybe a little salty, and it could have done with a few more whizzes from the stick blender as there were frequent pieces of potato. Wouldn't kill you to toast the ciabatta either. Still an improved showing on last night.

We ate dinner here in August 2021 

Mexican bean nachos 

Battered fish, chips and coleslaw

Despite being a Tuesday night during the off-season amidst a pandemic which precludes all international tourism, the South Sea Hotel was pumping. The food and drink was flowing, and everybody seemed to be having a good time. They undoubtedly benefit from being the only restaurant on Stewart Island that's open during winter, and frankly food-wise they had kind of phoned it in. Starting with the positives, the fish was fresh and tasty in a well-cooked batter that wasn't too oily. The chips were fine, but the coleslaw was a real snore, just cabbage and onion with no real flavour. And where's the tartare! The vegetarian nachos were pretty miserable. Completely flavourless bulk pack corn chips, under-seasoned bean mix and too much cheese. Points for the guacamole though.
