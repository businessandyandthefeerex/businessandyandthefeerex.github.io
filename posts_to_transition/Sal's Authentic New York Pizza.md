We ate lunch here in August 2021 

Nonna pizza (mozzerella, parmesan, garlic, basil) with chicken 

We're not experienced with New York style pizza, but Sal's fare does meet the depiction we are familiar with from TV and movies; large (check), thin (check), floppy (check), had to fold it down the middle to eat it (check). The tomato sauce and general flavour was pretty nice, dough was a bit bready at the edges, but the real problem was that once again we were struck down by dry chicken. Given that we had paid extra as recommended in the menu to add chicken to this pizza, it was pretty disappointing when after one piece we're thinking "wish I hadn't forked out extra for a dry old bird to ruin this dish".
