We ate dinner here in October 2021

Jalapeno poppers

Queso

Tacos: tempura battered fish, carne asada, and popcorn cauliflower

Loaded nachos with pulled pork

We made a terrible error here ordering food that was labelled with a red chilli pepper. That is on us, luckily it was only the popcorn cauliflower taco and aside from setting us on fire it was pretty good. The weakest taco was the carne asada which was pretty much all meat, and it was too much meat. Not a common gripe to have in a taco, but honestly it was excessive. The fish taco was good, and had a lovely sauce in it. The tacos were fantastic value for money, 3 large tacos for $20; we definitely ordered too much food. The poppers were great, exactly what you hope for, and likewise the queso was also pretty good, with great tortilla chips that had been made in house, and reasonable cheese dipping sauce. Like the carne asada tacos, the nachos came with a lot of meat, and were a bit overwhelming. Great chips, great guac, but the meat was too bountiful, and was unfortunately a bit flavourless.
