We ate dinner here in October 2024 

Peri-peri paneer pizza

Chicken tenders with chips and sweet chilli sauce 

Caramel thickshake 

What is it to 'dine-in'? Business Andy and the Fee-Rex only review dine-establishments. Golden Crust Pizza's signage states dine-in. And there are some tables and chairs, with salt and pepper at the tables. Sounds like dine-in so far. There was no table service, you had to order at the counter, but that's fine. Failure to provide water (except purchased bottled water) is unpleasant, but certainly not unprecedented, plenty of dingy cafe's do the same thing. The stickiness of the table was a clue that other patrons had also chosen to dine-in. 

When we ordered the server didn't ask dine-in or takeaway, which is a red flag. To ensure they knew, we even went up after ordering to tell them we were intending to dine-in. They did not bring the order to the table, instead they yell your name and you have to go up and get it, the red flag waving was getting quite intense at this point. The order comes in takeaway packaging with no cutlery provided, a cascade of red flags with flashing lights. We'd describe Golden Crust more as dine-in tolerated than a dine-in restaurant. The South Asian news playing on the huge telly above our table showing images of dying elephants didn't exactly stoke our appetite either. 

What did get our juices flowing was the pizza. Yum. It was spicy, but not too spicy, with great paneer, a good balance of other ingredients and the peri-peri sauce was ample but not excessive. The chicken tenders were also a pleasant surprise. They were sizeable and actually pretty tender, crumbed and served with a kinda-thin sweet chilli sauce. 

The chips were not good; way under-salted and only just cooked. The thickshake was also a real shame. If you're advertising a thickshake, that shake had better be thick. I'm talking hard-to-get-up-the-straw thick. This shake had been made with softserve ice cream and had a foamy texture, definitely not thick, and the caramel flavour was uninspired.
