We ate lunch here in July 2022

Chicken and veal burger with chips

Fish and chips

We would argue that fish and chips should come with a salad. We think it’s pretty normal, and having something to cut through the grease is valuable. Looks like Homestead Brewery doesn't agree. That said, the chips were great, but the fish was very crisp. Too crisp. 

The burger was divisive. We can both agree that the patty was unusual, it was made of a combination of chicken mince and veal mince, moulded into a patty and then deep fried. Business Andy felt that it was unusual and good, The Fee-Rex felt that it was unusual and bad. It doesn’t help that The Fee-Rex doesn’t like avocado when there is so much smeared over the bottom bun. Props to the overall construction and shape, Homestead Brewery has clearly read our recent review of Khandallah Trading Company and has gone wide not tall.
