We ate dinner here in August 2023 

Margarita pizza 

Loaded tater tots 

Miss Lucy's sits atop a backpackers in Queenstown and serves cocktails that are befitting of their station. The espresso martini was all foam and not sweet enough, and the dark & stormy way too gingerey and also unmixed so the first mouthful was nothing but rum. Unfortunately Miss Lucy's wasn't saved by the food, none of which was anything to get too excited about.
