Bruschetta

Pear, parmesan, and rocket salad

Spring vegetable rigatoni 

This place looks a bit plush, vaulted tiled ceilings, green leather booths, cloth napkins, the whole shebang. The food is on the fancy side, but the prices weren't that high considering. The bruschetta was a standout, and was made with three different varieties of cherry tomato, so it looked great too. The salad was overdressed, but came with plenty of parmesan, however you couldn't taste much of anything but dressing. And the rigatoni was very nice, with the right ratio of pasta to spring vegetables.
