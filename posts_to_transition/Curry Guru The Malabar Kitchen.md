Curry Guru The Malabar Kitchen

We ate lunch here in August 2021 

Paneer butter masala and rice

Butter chicken and rice

Plain naan

Cheese and garlic naan 

Curry Guru was a mixed bag. On one hand, their paneer was truly excellent; soft, delicious, great texture, and the accompanying sauce was pretty good. However, the butter chicken had a serious case of tomato soup-itis, although it did contain plenty of nice chicken. Surprisingly the naans were the weakest link. The plain naan was too thick and doughy, and the cheese and garlic naan was very heavy on the cheese, very light on the garlic. The menu advertised the naan would be filled with cottage cheese, but it clearly contained copious amounts of flavourless mozzerella. It's not the first time we've fallen for this bait-and-switch and we just don't understand. Why mozzerella? Cheddar, colby, edam, any of the hard cheeses would have been better. Or, crazy thought, put in cottage cheese like you said you would. Shout out to their $10 lunch special, which was nearly the same size as the full curry and great value for money.
