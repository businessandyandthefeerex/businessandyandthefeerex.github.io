We ate dinner here in November 2023 

Lasagne, salad and roast potato

Pumpkin carrot and leek soup

Cheesy garlic bread 

Hey Pukenui Pacific, ever heard of salt? Or seasoning of any kind? I don’t know why we’re bothering asking, we’ve eaten your food. And it was incredibly bland. Even the roast potatoes, which looked very promising externally, tasted like nothing. Disappointing across the board *sad head shake*
