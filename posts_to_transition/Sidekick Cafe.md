We ate lunch here in July 2024

Mozzarella and prosciutto toasted sandwich 

Everything bagel with jalapeno cream cheese 

Orange and almond cake 

Peanut butter banana smoothie 

Sidekick cafe is keeping it simple with a small cabinet and no cooked menu. Sometimes this is a disaster, but when everything is good, you don’t need much to choose from. 

We were particularly impressed by the bagel. Not only was it fresh, chewy, perfectly toasted and had a great mix of seeds, but they service it with cream cheese choc full of tiny chopped up pieces of jalapeño. That doesn’t sound that inventive, sounds like something that everyone should be doing, but this isn’t a dish we’ve found before and it was bloody nice. 

The toasted sandwich was made with a very nice bread, and had moments of greatness when all the ingredients aligned. Unfortunately it also had some dead zones, areas with no prosciutto or mozzarella where you were just eating bread. 

The cake was a little too dense, but super tasty, a real marmalade stickiness to it that was very pleasant. The smoothie was lovely. Sometimes the nut milk peanut butter smoothies can come out to be a really funky texture and are more concerned with being healthy than being yum, but this smoothie was straddling that line with ease.
