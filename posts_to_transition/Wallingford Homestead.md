Wallingford Homestead

Wallingford, Central Hawkes Bay 

Rating: 4 

We ate dinner here in June 2024 

9 course degustation menu 

Wallingford is a beautiful old (1850s) country homestead converted into a B&B. In the evenings they serve gorgeous meals and while most diners are staying at the accommodation, this is not a prerequisite to eat here. 

The food was excellent, but the portions were way too big. We were essentially comatose afterwards, and not in a good way. The lamb in particular should have been halved in size. As is common with fine dining, they serve you a bunch of stuff you've never heard of, or that sounds questionable (kumara ice cream anyone?) but they've made it absolutely delicious. Neither of us rate crayfish, but the first course crayfish cracker with avocado and lime was outstanding, and you'd have never known it was made with crayfish. The mandarin duck was another standout, as was the pasta made from milled acorns (what?) with mushrooms.
