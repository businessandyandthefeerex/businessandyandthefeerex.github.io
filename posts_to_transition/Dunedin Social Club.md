We ate lunch here in August 2021

Mushroom & spring onion arancini

Pulled pork cheeseburger with chips 

Dunedin Social Club is more a bar with a menu than a restaurant. Or rather, a raspberry and lemonade dispensary with a bar and menu attached; jug after jug of the house specialty was served while we were there. And there weren't even many other people there with us. Although their menu is small, they've gone to some trouble to put some interesting items in there. That said, the results were only so-so. The arancini was bland and a bit claggy. The cheeseburger was better, but there was definitely no cheese in it and it could have used more sauce.
