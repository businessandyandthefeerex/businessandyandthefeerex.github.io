Der Metz

We ate dinner here in February 2021

Deutsche platte (big ol' platter of meats)

JÃ¤gerschnitzel (beef schnitzel with mushroom gravy)

The decor at Der Metz, like the meat, was plentiful, overwhelming, and excellent. The walls were covered in all sorts, but dominated by a giant portrait of Kaiser Wilhelm. The waitresses wore dirndls, and the beer came in 1L steins, making it look very German in there. The key indicator of quality for a schnitzel is the gristle content, and this schnitzel had very little gristle. There was one gristly mouthful in a schnitzel the size of Nebraska. The mash was a great accompaniment, and the mushroom gravy was delicious. Staring down the meat mountain aka Deutche platter, was a daunting prospect. This meal was meat, lots of it, and two kinds of sauerkraut, less of it. Sausages, roast pork, pork belly, all of it good, and the sauerkraut was a pleasant surprise. But the best part was the dumplings. While there are three vegetarian options on the menu, this place is clearly all about the meat. Top tip: get an extra serve of gravy on the side.
