We ate dinner here in July 2024 

Chilli fried beef 

Mongolian lamb

Golden Dragon looks like your typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese joint. Sparsely populated with customers and absolutely heaving with red and gold tasselled decorations. Then, as if to say “you don’t know me”, the music was 100% ballads from the 50s. I’m talking ‘born free as free as the wind blows as free as the grass grows”, proper jams you might hear at your granddad's wake. 

The cuisine was more traditional than the soundtrack. We were big fans of the plentiful rice, which came in an extremely cute insulated plastic screw top container. It blows our minds how many places stinge out on the rice. It costs like a dollar per tonne, don’t just give us a little thimbleful. 

The beef was freshly fried and pretty spicy, but not unmanageably so. The lamb had occasional gristle but was mostly decent and came sizzling hot with a tasty sauce. While this meal wasn’t “unforgettable” - a reference to the 1959 Nat King Cole banger we heard at dinner tonight, but it was pretty good.
