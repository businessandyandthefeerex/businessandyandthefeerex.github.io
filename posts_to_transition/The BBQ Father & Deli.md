We ate dinner here in July 2024

Beef brisket, chips and coleslaw 

Chicken, salami, gorgonzola, and jalapeno pizza

While we were impressed by how quickly our meals came out at the BBQ Father & Deli, we were only so-so about the meals themselves. Some parts were really good, like the crisp and seasoned chips, the very thin pizza base, and the smoky sauce on the brisket. Others weren't good at all, like the dry brisket itself, the supermarket-esque coleslaw on the side, and the eyewatering overabundance of jalapeno on the pizza. 

It was a bit of a shame, really, to do so well on a few aspects, and then throw it all away by messing up some pretty basic stuff. Cut the jalapeno down by half, and then we'll see about that pizza. Cook the brisket a bit closer to dinner time and double the sauce budget, and then we'll see about that brisket. And just throw that particular coleslaw right in the bin.
