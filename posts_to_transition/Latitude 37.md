Latitude 37
Jan 26, 2023
1 min read

Mt Maunganui, Bay of Plenty

Rating : 3 

We ate dinner here in January 2023 

Arancini balls 

Pork belly

Fried cauliflower

Duck liver pate 

Chocolatete mousse dome 

Creme brûlée 

At Latitude 37 everything was good, but nothing was excellent. Across the board there were no standouts in either direction, it was just universally enjoyable. They could do with turning the music down a few decibels as you definitely had to shout especially once the live music started. And shout to their cocktail menu, especially the clockwork orange.
