Perhaps the best thing about Kika is that you don't even have to look at the menu. They have a "just feed me" option where they'll pick you out three starters, a main with two sides, and a dessert. With matched wine or beer if you'd like. We opted for this and were extremely happy with everything that came our way. Don't worry, you can specify "no seafood" or "no tomato" as needed. The fee-rex's favourite dish was the duck waffle which was delightfully unusual. Business Andy preferred the artichokes. Bookings are highly recommended, we were very lucky to get a table without a booking, we were there ten minutes after they opened and while we were sitting there everyone else who didn't have a booking was turned away.
