Secondly, the site where this Coffee Club now stands used to house a different cafe from which the Fee-Rex was fired as a teenager, so this was a bit of a destination. Let’s start on a positive - the burger was actually very nice. While the brisket itself was slightly dry, this was more than masked by the ample sauce. On the meh side, the smoothie had unfortunately been made with an under-ripe banana, resulting in a stringy and dry aftertaste. Smoothie texture and coolness was good. The vegan chicken salad sucked. We know what you’re thinking, perhaps we brought this on ourselves for ordering a vegan chicken salad. After all, we’re not even vegan. However, we firmly believe that any diner, vegans included, should be able to have a tasty meal, which this salad was not. The “vegan chicken” was extraordinarily dry and liberally doused in a hot sauce from the underpants of satan himself. The rest of the salad was actually fine, but the sauce had pervaded all, and the “chicken” was too offensive to be redeemed.\n",

The skin on the fish was so slimy there was no way it had been in a pan. More like boiled by the taste of things. The couscous and salsa were no help.

Either they didn’t serve the same burger last time the judges rolled around, or there’s something rotten at the Dunedin Burger Society.

Speaking as people, it wouldn’t have been our choice. Onto the roast vege salad, and we feel the need to issue a warning. If you order a roast vege salad in the winter in the South Island, you will get snipped. Par-snipped. Bloody parsnip for Africa in that salad. The salad was already underwhelming - not enough dressing, an absurd amount of lamb, and lacking nuts or something that would give some texture, but to then have to wade through mountains of parsnip, it was just too much.\n",

There was so much variety, generally four or five different types of everything eg there was a blue cheese, Camembert, some cheese with wax and some other hard cheese, then four different crackers, for meats there were two different salamis, plus ham and some kind of hot pork, there were apricots, figs, apple, grapes, dates, plus tomatoes, hummus, beetroot dip, macadamias, cashews. It was great fun trying all the different combinations and somehow everything seemed to work together pretty well. It was also beautifully presented on fern fronds.\n\nThe tomato and mozzarella was beautifully presented and flavourful. The parfait was tasty but way too much, could have used about half of that. The eye fillet was perfectly cooked and succulent. Some kind of marmite-esque blobs were on the plate and they were a flavour explosion. The mash with the chicken was a standout, don’t know what was in it but it was really good, perhaps the only thing that wasn’t pretty much perfect was the chicken which was slightly dry.\n\nThe mille-feuille was perfection, deconstructed and imaginative, every bite was heaven.

We spied a little toastie place two doors down and boy are we glad that we did.\n\nThe menu was small but innovative, there were salmon toasties, tuna toasties, and vegan kimchi toasties to name a few, and the toasties themselves were just excellent.

Along with the expected Bluff Oysters, there are also paua wontons, sweetbreads, whitebait, and mutton bird. Feeling adventurous, and keen on some local fare, the Fee-Rex decided to try mutton bird for the first time. It turns out that mutton bird, which is a sea bird in the shearwater family, is hella fishy. Even the smell is that of fish, and quite strong. It does look like mutton, which is perhaps where it gets the name, but it tastes like fish.\n\nThe flavour of the mutton bird has not been considered as part of the rating. We went out on a limb, and the restaurant can’t be penalised because we ordered something that just wasn’t us. That said, the rest of the meal was pretty bad. The stuffing was plain, and very dry. Other than a few (cold) blueberries on the plate, the jus was neither to be seen nor tasted. The mash was the best part, and the “seasonal” vegetables, the worst. We didn’t realise that boiled frozen vege mix had a season! For $40, in Bluff no less, we expect fresh vegetables.\n\nThe ribs were dry, although they did come with quite a nice sauce, and plenty of it, which did help some. The ribs were sitting in top of a big ol’ pile of chips, which ordinarily we are all for, but there were some problems with these chips. You know when you’re hung over on a Sunday morning, and your pour your McCain frozen chips into a roasting dish and slam them in the oven after finally falling out of bed just after 11am, and then you are ready for chips way before they are ready for you, so you get them out, half done, not crispy at all in fact a little soggy, those chips are full of sadness, and after eating them, so are you. That’s exactly what these chips were like, and frankly our disappointment is immeasurable. There was a little bit of salad on the side which was reasonable, but it was as much as afterthought as every salad that’s ever been on the side of a plate of ribs and chips has ever been.\n",

Every chair, every table cloth, every curtain, every tacky postcard and dusty trinket, they’re all still there. The service was indifferent, although they did light a candle at our table which romanced up the joint a bit.\n\nIt wasn’t all negative. The pasta was actually rather nice. Great flavour, a little kick of chilli, and the right amount of parmesan, it was a pasta we would eat again. But the steak was truly awful. It was a nice piece of meat and plenty of it, but way under cooked (we ordered medium, this was rare to medium-rare). But the true horror was the sauce.

Every chair, every table cloth, every curtain, every tacky postcard and dusty trinket, they’re all still there. The service was indifferent, although they did light a candle at our table which romanced up the joint a bit.\n\nIt wasn’t all negative. The pasta was actually rather nice. Great flavour, a little kick of chilli, and the right amount of parmesan, it was a pasta we would eat again. But the steak was truly awful. It was a nice piece of meat and plenty of it, but way under cooked (we ordered medium, this was rare to medium-rare). But the true horror was the sauce. Gelatinous and smacking of vinegary cheap red wine, Business Andy was literally scraping it off the steak.

The keen observer could plainly see that this was the same gravy that came with the chops, and probably came from the very tray that they were cooked in. And while we’re not usually the types to question the addition of gravy, it’s a bit much to serve it as part of a vegetarian meal.\n\nAlso inexplicably, the brownie was still Glad wrapped when it arrived without fanfare, without yoghurt or cream, without being heated, and even without a plate.

There were some sausage rolls in there that probably would have enjoyed some tomato relish on the side, but it was just the wrong flavour to have with the spinach and mushroom filo.

You’ve been on this busy corner for 25 years and you’ve gotten complacent. You were lucky to become an institution, we’ve seen better establishments than you come and go. Business Andy has fond memories of previous visits here, and we expected better.\n\nThe first three mouthfuls of the chicken burger were somehow all bread. Where’s the sauce? We could see the chicken, yet somehow none was in our mouth. There was just not enough sauce, not enough chicken, not even enough coleslaw. The chips were yummy but paired with an aioli that was way too mustardy.\n\nThe pizza sounded really yummy. The sauce base was a parmesan white sauce, rather than the traditional tomato. Something different, we’re always keen for that.

You’ve been on this busy corner for 25 years and you’ve gotten complacent. You were lucky to become an institution, we’ve seen better establishments than you come and go. Business Andy has fond memories of previous visits here, and we expected better.\n\nThe first three mouthfuls of the chicken burger were somehow all bread. Where’s the sauce? We could see the chicken, yet somehow none was in our mouth. There was just not enough sauce, not enough chicken, not even enough coleslaw. The chips were yummy but paired with an aioli that was way too mustardy.\n\nThe pizza sounded really yummy. The sauce base was a parmesan white sauce, rather than the traditional tomato. Something different, we’re always keen for that.

And while Rothko does indeed have all the trappings of a fancy restaurant, they really fell down where the actual food was concerned.\n\nIt wasn’t a disaster, and they started out quite strong with a very good bread full of tasty nuts, with a really flavoursome butter on the side. But from then on they were really coasting, perhaps hoping we would be distracted by the beautiful surroundings and wouldn’t look too hard at the food.\n\nRegular readers will already know that Business Andy doesn’t particularly like mozzarella, and Rothko did little to change his opinion.

        "content": "Bread with whipped butter\nBuffalo mozzarella\nBeetroot ravioli\nPork loin\n\nSituated right next to a pretty fun art gallery, and the outdoor Sculptureum, one might expect to find a pretty nice restaurant. And while Rothko does indeed have all the trappings of a fancy restaurant, they really fell down where the actual food was concerned.\n\nIt wasn’t a disaster, and they started out quite strong with a very good bread full of tasty nuts, with a really flavoursome butter on the side. But from then on they were really coasting, perhaps hoping we would be distracted by the beautiful surroundings and wouldn’t look too hard at the food.\n\nRegular readers will already know that Business Andy doesn’t particularly like mozzarella, and Rothko did little to change his opinion.

Then things took a turn. The tenders were grilled and nothing special, the sauce (we went with mild for the chicken) was uninspired. Then even worse was the “spicy” rice. We had been concerned that ordering spicy rice in a place specialising in spice could blast our tastebuds. We couldn’t have been more wrong. There was nothing spicy about it. There was nothing tasty about it either. It was white rice covered with some kind of anaemic yellow spice and nothing little kernels of corn and peas. Tragic.\n\nDespite a couple of serious missteps, we were big fans of this place. Special shout out to the hostess who went out of her way to guide us in our selection and was truly delightful.

We often scarf down cocktails at lightning speed; these two were both left at the end of the meal and it was hard going to finish them.\n\nNothing from the buffet was really worth eating. The raspberry jelly was alright. The brownie was alright, but we don’t believe any of the slices, or the hard bready little donuts, were made on site. The roast potatoes were acceptable but lacked crispness. The bread rolls were squished and firm. The 24-hour slow roast beef with homemade gravy was a great disappointment.

        "excerpt": "Paneer iskender\nButter paneer pizza\n\nNZ Kebab &amp; Pizza house does Turkish food and pizzas (surprise, surprise), but with an Indian twist. We’ve never seen paneer iskender before, and were keen to give it a go. Tell you what, it was pretty good. The paneer went well with the sauces, with the sticky rice and with the salads. Halloumi is usually the cheese associated with Turkish food, and we are all for halloumi, but having tried both we’d say the paneer is just as good.\n\nShame about the pizza though. The butter paneer pizza, which is just their butter chicken pizza but with paneer instead of chicken, had some serious issues. Firstly, the amount of cheese was ridiculous. We like cheese as much as the next guy, but when it’s compromising the integrity of the dish, when it’s so laden with cheese that the slices are falling to pieces under the immense weight, then you’ve gone too far. The Fee-Rex used a knife and fork for the whole thing, a tragic sight. The other toppings were no bueno. There were tiny little pieces of capsicum and tomato, plus some raw red onion. They bought nothing to the occasion. Then there was the butter chicken sauce. Sweet heavens was it salty. The flavour, while reminiscent of a curry, was not enjoyable and some patches had too much sauce.\n\nWe were also disappointed to be served in takeaway containers. This restaurant very clearly encourages dine in. They have a huge dining area, lots of tables, far too many chairs (seriously, the four person table next to us had seven chairs!), and even had menus on the tables. Yet our iskender came out in a cardboard container, the pizza in a box, and we got two wooden sporks and one plastic knife. The fact that these implements could easily cut through the pizza was a further indictment upon its structure. It’s not hard to slide a pizza onto a plate. We propose that NZ Kebab &amp; Pizza is costing itself more in disposable materials and paying to dispose of bulky pizza boxes than it would cost for some cheap plates and cutlery. And it would sure enhance the dining experience. Speaking of enhancing the dining experience, a shout out to our server who was truly delightful.\n",

We were asked for genuine feedback. We’re not talking about the perfunctory “how was your meal” either. When dropping off the tiramisu, the waiter said “we’ve had this on the specials menu for a couple of weeks, would love your feedback.” We subsequently didn’t see that waiter again, but hopefully he gets to read this review. So here goes - the flavours were yummy, we liked the crumbled up biscoff on the top, but that was not a tiramisu. It had no coffee. Also it was very sweet, especially with the caramel in the bottom so it became cloying after a while. Also, the glass you served it in was too tall. We recommend you try soaking the biscoff in coffee, the way you would for ladyfingers in a traditional tiramisu.\n\nThat’s an unfortunate way to start this review, as actually we really liked eating here. The pizza was extremely good. Thin, crispy base. Cheesy but not too much. All the flavours worked really well together. And the rocket was carefully distributed and of an appropriate amount. We’d eat that again any day of the week. We were excited to see the dessert arancini, which was a first for us. The balls contained rice, like a fried rice pudding, with plenty of cinnamon, tonnes of blueberries, the right amount of white chocolate, the whole thing was top tier.\n\nThe cauliflower was very controversial. The Fee-Rex found it bland, didn’t appreciate the cherry tomatoes, and was looking around on the table like is there some salt here I can apply. Business Andy thought it was marvellous. He could really taste the parmesan and thought the cherry tomatoes were a perfect accompaniment. We could at least both agree that the crispy roast bits on the edges were very pleasant.\n",

The pide dough was yum, but the filling was a bit light on flavour and tasted too much like just lamb mince.\n\nShout out to Ayhan and his service. He was friendly, served us on proper plates/wooden boards with proper cutlery (not a given, the soggy gozleme place served us in takeaway boxes), gave us a bowl of accompanying sauce AND three after-dinner mentos. We appreciate the details.\n",

This has only occurred a handful of times in BAATFR history, so it’s a pretty big deal.\n\nThe eggplant ravioli was a sensation. For starters, it was a reasonable sized meal, not like sometimes when you buy ravioli and there are just two offensive little flat pastas in a huge bowl. The eggplant flavour was sublime. Eggplant can be a real hit and miss flavour, but this was truly superb, and was well balanced with cheese and tomato sauces.\n\nThe pizza was a dumpster fire. It came with an entire 200g family packet of rocket deposited in the middle, covered in oil and bits of truffle. What the hell was that doing there? For one thing, it wasn’t a listed ingredient on the menu. For another thing, it was an insane volume of rocket. We had to eat some of it just straight as salad to try to contain it. The pizza had either no sauce, or a flavourless white sauce, it was hard to tell for reasons we will get to momentarily, but It was light on flavour to put it mildly. And yet there was clearly some kind of liquid at play. The entire centre was sodden, dripping, the texture of Weetbix that had been left in milk for an entire day, making it extremely difficult to eat. Not that you wanted to once you had tasted it, but that’s besides the point. You picked up a slice and the centre half of the triangle just slopped down into a soggy pile. We had to use forks to fold the waterlogged mess back in on itself, then stuff the whole unholy package into our mouths. Totally disgusting.\n\nSpeaking of totally disgusting, some gratis bread showed up at the table. We absolutely love gratis bread, who doesn’t? But we have to say, if the bread is hard enough to be used as a weapon, perhaps it isn’t suitable to serve. This bread, which was probably pretty nice at one stage, had been toasted within an inch of its life. It miraculously wasn’t burned, but it was hard as rock. We didn’t know that material science had progressed this far, usually when you temper bread like this there is at least a trace of soot. Anyway you feared for your life biting into it, the risk of a shard breaking off and impaling you through your palate all the way up into your brain was exhilaratingly real.\n",

She promptly forgot to bring more water, and another waiter eventually took our dessert order. It took so long we had started a countdown, deciding if 10 more items came out of the kitchen before we got service that we were going to forego the dessert and second round of drinks.

They serve a chefs choice menu, where you get what you’re given but they will work around dietary requirements. Because of this, bookings are essential.\n\nThree of the four dishes tonight were outstanding. The curry puff was so fluffy and flavourful, nothing like the hard little deep fried rocks you sometimes get at takeaway places. The soup was supremely well blended, not some lumpy lentil concoction but a creamy, rich bowl of happiness. The paratha and raita on the side were welcome, although their connection with the soup was unclear.\n\nThe Fee-Rex had never had a souffle before (evidently Business Andy is fancier than she is), and it did not disappoint. Crazily fluffy with a distinct but balanced banana flavour, we can see what the souffle fuss is about (the souffluss?). The homemade ice cream had strong, deep chocolate and coffee flavours and was the perfect accompaniment .\n\nThe only dish to miss the mark a little was the chicken. It was still good, but it wasn’t great. Some elements were tepid when they arrived, which didn’t help, and a bit more gravy wouldn’t have gone astray. The potatoes were sublime, and we appreciated the lack of parsnips (the devils veg).\n\nAll in all this was a great meal. If you’re going to visit, bring your appetite.

They did not bring the order to the table, instead they yell your name and you have to go up and get it, the red flag waving was getting quite intense at this point. The order comes in takeaway packaging with no cutlery provided, a cascade of red flags with flashing lights. We’d describe Golden Crust more as dine-in tolerated than a dine-in restaurant. The South Asian news playing on the huge telly above our table showing images of dying elephants didn’t exactly stoke our appetite either.\n\nWhat did get our juices flowing was the pizza. Yum. It was spicy, but not too spicy, with great paneer, a good balance of other ingredients and the peri-peri sauce was ample but not excessive. The chicken tenders were also a pleasant surprise. They were sizeable and actually pretty tender, crumbed and served with a kinda-thin sweet chilli sauce.\n\nThe chips were not good; way under-salted and only just cooked. The thickshake was also a real shame. If you’re advertising a thickshake, that shake had better be thick. I’m talking hard-to-get-up-the-straw thick.

While the chicken itself was actually quite good, everything else in the bowl was just a huge slog. And it was all made worse, or at least much harder to eat by the awful wooden fork.\n\nThe burger was okay overall, although the bun was far too dry, and the same for the patty. At least the sauces were pretty good.\n\nThe waffle fries were the complete opposite experience, good waffle fries, but awful sauce. It was supposed to be gochujang mayo, but that flavour was indiscernible, it may as well have just had a few drops of tabasco sauce in it for all we could taste.\n",

As part of a large group we got a table under cover nestled amongst the vines with a gentle breeze coming through, pure perfection. Also as part of a large group, we were happy to drink and be merry with our own company. Which is a lucky thing, as we were in for a wait. To their credit, the waiter did let us know they were extremely busy and bring out some complimentary bread. Regardless, the wait was substantial. What was worse than the wait, however, was the dripping nature with which food came out. There shouldn’t be a fifteen minute gap between the first and last meal coming out, that’s just poor kitchen management.\n\nMuch of the food was worth the weight. We can wholeheartedly recommend the steak, arancini and particularly the profiteroles which were inventive and exciting. Unfortunately the bread and the dessert let the meal down a bit. The bread was perfectly fine, but wasn’t anything to write home about, as was the adffogato. The brûlée was the worst of the lot, with way too much baileys in it which frankly ruined the flavour.\n",

On one hand, door open helps traffic flow and encourages customers for the takeaway trade, as well as discouraging loitering dine-in clientele (AKA the Burger King technique). On the other hand, it’s pretty bloody cold in autumn for your dine in customers. We ate in our puffer jackets.\n\nLuckily, the food was very good. The pide was flavourful with good sized chunks of salami, it wasn’t greasy like some pide can be, and the ends weren’t just useless nubbins of doughy bread, the topping went all the way to the end. It also came with two fantastic accompaniments - yellow chillis and pickled cabbage. We were skeptical when we saw these. The waiter warned us the chillis were hot, and he was quite correct as the Fee-Rex learned when she tried to eat one straight up. However, when used as intended as a pairing to the pide it was a fantastic addition, as was the cabbage.\n\nThe halloumi iskender was also strong. There was plenty of everything and in good ratios. Generous with the hummus too, which is nice to see. Yes there could have been more halloumi, but that’s basically always the case.\n",
