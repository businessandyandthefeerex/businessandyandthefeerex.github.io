Then the irrefutable truth of the buffet dawns on us and we remember that, while good buffets do exist, they are extremely rare.\n\nStratosfare thinks quite highly of itself, but doesn’t have the chops (or other meats) to back it up. We will say they are correct about the view, it’s pretty nice. And we appreciated the bustling hive of activity up on the hill, between the mountain bike competition, the gondolas, the luge, the freshly sheared alpacas, there was plenty to see.\n\nStratosfare is a bar, as well as a restaurant, and they have a good looking cocktail menu. Unfortunately, the cocktails themselves were downright awful. We got a salted caramel espresso martini and a black forest mudslide. Yum yum, right? Wrong. After taking an extremely long time to arrive, the black forest had a nasty liquer taste while the martini was watery and not sweet, and didn’t have that delicious coffee flavour either. We often scarf down cocktails at lightning speed; these two were both left at the end of the meal and it was hard going to finish them.\n\nNothing from the buffet was really worth eating. The raspberry jelly was alright. The brownie was alright, but we don’t believe any of the slices, or the hard bready little donuts, were made on site. The roast potatoes were acceptable but lacked crispness. The bread rolls were squished and firm. The 24-hour slow roast beef with homemade gravy was a great disappointment. The guy was carving it right there, he could work around the gristle if he wanted. But he didn’t want to, and the Fee-Rex literally had to spit a piece out when she found out it was 80% hyper-chewy gristle. The gravy was foul. It had a very strong flavour like somebody had put in a whole tub of Marmite. Hell, maybe even a whole tub of Vegemite.\n\nThe desserts were the best of a bad bunch. The pavlova was okay with a nice mix of fruit on top. They offered six different ice cream flavours, which we appreciated, but it was all very airy, non-creamy, the cheapest of the cheap. The mousse had a bitter cocoa flavour. We definitely regretted the amount of dessert we took, so if you are going to come to Stratosfare (which you shouldn’t), approach with caution.\n",

When dropping off the tiramisu, the waiter said “we’ve had this on the specials menu for a couple of weeks, would love your feedback.” We subsequently didn’t see that waiter again, but hopefully he gets to read this review. So here goes - the flavours were yummy, we liked the crumbled up biscoff on the top, but that was not a tiramisu. It had no coffee. Also it was very sweet, especially with the caramel in the bottom so it became cloying after a while. Also, the glass you served it in was too tall. We recommend you try soaking the biscoff in coffee, the way you would for ladyfingers in a traditional tiramisu.\n\nThat’s an unfortunate way to start this review, as actually we really liked eating here. The pizza was extremely good. Thin, crispy base. Cheesy but not too much. All the flavours worked really well together. And the rocket was carefully distributed and of an appropriate amount. We’d eat that again any day of the week. We were excited to see the dessert arancini, which was a first for us. The balls contained rice, like a fried rice pudding, with plenty of cinnamon, tonnes of blueberries, the right amount of white chocolate, the whole thing was top tier.\n\nThe cauliflower was very controversial. The Fee-Rex found it bland, didn’t appreciate the cherry tomatoes, and was looking around on the table like is there some salt here I can apply. Business Andy thought it was marvellous. He could really taste the parmesan and thought the cherry tomatoes were a perfect accompaniment. We could at least both agree that the crispy roast bits on the edges were very pleasant.\n",

        "excerpt": "Shredded duck with plum sauce on rice\nTofu with vegetables and spicy sauce on rice\n\nA1 Takeaways, despite the name, does do dine-in. It’s only 4 tables, but you’ll probably be fine without a reservation. We were impressed that, compared to recent experiences, A1 asked us if we were dining in and, when we said yes, served us on a plate rather than in a takeaway container. Was the plate paper and the cutlery a wooden fork? Sure. But some effort was made. We also enjoyed when a squad of four lads came in later who were clearly friendly with the owner. They were having a good yarn and organising dates for something. It gave a sense that A1 is a real part of the community. Points for super speedy service, and for value for money too. (especially the tofu - $13.50 for a full sized meal!)\n\nWe regret that we’re unable to gush so emphatically about the food itself. The duck was of pretty good quality, nice skin, but came chopped rather than shredded as advertised. The plum sauce was extremely sweet, pale, and not recognisable as plum. The tofu had an unpleasant fryer taste and the ‘spicy’ sauce was more sweet than spicy.\n",
