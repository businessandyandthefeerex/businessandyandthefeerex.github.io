The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running down the spout into the receiver.

There were alembics with two (dibikos) and three (tribikos) receivers.[4] According to Zosimos of Panopolis, the alembic was invented by Mary the Jewess.[5]\n\nThe anbik is described by Ibn al-Awwam in his Kitab al-Filaha (Book of Agriculture), where he explains how rose-water is distilled. Amongst others, it is mentioned in the Mafatih al-Ulum (Key of Sciences) of Khwarizmi and the Kitab al-Asrar (Book of Secrets) of Al-Razi.

        "content": "A pot still is a type of still used in distilling spirits such as whisky or brandy. Heat is applied directly to the pot containing the wash (for whisky) or wine (for brandy). This is called a batch distillation (as opposed to a continuous distillation).\n\nAt standard atmospheric pressure, alcohol boils at 78 °C (172 °F), while water boils at 100 °C (212 °F). During distillation, the vapour contains more alcohol than the liquid. When the vapours are condensed, the resulting liquid contains a higher concentration of alcohol. In the pot still, the alcohol and water vapour combine with esters and flow from the still through the condensing coil. There they condense into the first distillation liquid, the so-called “low wines”. The low wines have a strength of about 25–35% alcohol by volume, and flow into a second still. It is then distilled a second time to produce the colourless spirit, collected at about 70% alcohol by volume. Colour is added through maturation in an oak aging barrel, and develops over time.\n\nThe modern pot still is a descendant of the alembic, an earlier distillation device.\n",

Then the irrefutable truth of the buffet dawns on us and we remember that, while good buffets do exist, they are extremely rare.\n\nStratosfare thinks quite highly of itself, but doesn’t have the chops (or other meats) to back it up. We will say they are correct about the view, it’s pretty nice. And we appreciated the bustling hive of activity up on the hill, between the mountain bike competition, the gondolas, the luge, the freshly sheared alpacas, there was plenty to see.\n\nStratosfare is a bar, as well as a restaurant, and they have a good looking cocktail menu. Unfortunately, the cocktails themselves were downright awful. We got a salted caramel espresso martini and a black forest mudslide. Yum yum, right? Wrong. After taking an extremely long time to arrive, the black forest had a nasty liquer taste while the martini was watery and not sweet, and didn’t have that delicious coffee flavour either.

The raspberry jelly was alright. The brownie was alright, but we don’t believe any of the slices, or the hard bready little donuts, were made on site. The roast potatoes were acceptable but lacked crispness. The bread rolls were squished and firm. The 24-hour slow roast beef with homemade gravy was a great disappointment. The guy was carving it right there, he could work around the gristle if he wanted. But he didn’t want to, and the Fee-Rex literally had to spit a piece out when she found out it was 80% hyper-chewy gristle. The gravy was foul. It had a very strong flavour like somebody had put in a whole tub of Marmite. Hell, maybe even a whole tub of Vegemite.\n\nThe desserts were the best of a bad bunch. The pavlova was okay with a nice mix of fruit on top. They offered six different ice cream flavours, which we appreciated, but it was all very airy, non-creamy, the cheapest of the cheap. The mousse had a bitter cocoa flavour. We definitely regretted the amount of dessert we took, so if you are going to come to Stratosfare (which you shouldn’t), approach with caution.\n\nWebsite https://rotorua.skyline.co.nz/things-to-do/stratosfare-restaurant-rotorua/?utm_source=gmb_listing&amp;utm_medium=organic\n",

We were asked for genuine feedback. We’re not talking about the perfunctory “how was your meal” either. When dropping off the tiramisu, the waiter said “we’ve had this on the specials menu for a couple of weeks, would love your feedback.” We subsequently didn’t see that waiter again, but hopefully he gets to read this review. So here goes - the flavours were yummy, we liked the crumbled up biscoff on the top, but that was not a tiramisu. It had no coffee. Also it was very sweet, especially with the caramel in the bottom so it became cloying after a while. Also, the glass you served it in was too tall. We recommend you try soaking the biscoff in coffee, the way you would for ladyfingers in a traditional tiramisu.\n\nThat’s an unfortunate way to start this review, as actually we really liked eating here. The pizza was extremely good. Thin, crispy base. Cheesy but not too much. All the flavours worked really well together. And the rocket was carefully distributed and of an appropriate amount. We’d eat that again any day of the week. We were excited to see the dessert arancini, which was a first for us. The balls contained rice, like a fried rice pudding, with plenty of cinnamon, tonnes of blueberries, the right amount of white chocolate, the whole thing was top tier.\n\nThe cauliflower was very controversial. The Fee-Rex found it bland, didn’t appreciate the cherry tomatoes, and was looking around on the table like is there some salt here I can apply. Business Andy thought it was marvellous. He could really taste the parmesan and thought the cherry tomatoes were a perfect accompaniment. We could at least both agree that the crispy roast bits on the edges were very pleasant.\n\nWebsite https://urbangusto.co.nz/\n",
